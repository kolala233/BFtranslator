Our Lifespan@Before the Day of Awakening, they say we used to live very little... Only a few days or moons!|next|And most of that time, we were helpless larvae... Marriage marked |line|the end of life!|next|It's inconceivable nowadays. For one, we don't even remember being larvae!|next|Truly, becoming an adult is like being born. And then, we get to enjoy this beautiful land for many years.|next|It's hard not to pity our antcestors, who had to give up life soon after becoming aware of it...!
The Crowning of Elizant II@After tears were shed over Elizant's too sudden retirement, it was time to crown the new Queen.|next|Elizant II's speech radiated power over kindness, leaving many uneasy.|next|Although everyone cheered, doubt and fear festered amongst the populace.|next|They could only wait and pray their new Queen would be just.
Ladybug Exile@It had been just one moon after Queen Elizant II took the throne.|next|Farmer ants kept reporting the disappearance of many Aphid Eggs!|next|After a thorough investigation, a band of seventeen ladybugs were found to be the culprits.|next|Yes, seventeen!|next|Her Majesty acted quick, and restricted entry of most ladybugs |line|from the Ant Kingdom.|next|As of the time this book was written, many special permits are |line|required for them to visit.|next|The move was seen as very controversial, and has been the |line|Queen's most criticized decision.|next|It remains to be seen how our generation will handle the shifts |line|caused by this event.
Lesser Bugs@After the Day of Awakening, many bugs changed form. We "evolved" to be able to live as we do now.|next|But not all bugs evolved, some remained untouched by the Awakening. |line|We call them "lesser bugs".|next|Spiders, Midges, Weevils and some others did not gain sentience. They remained unchanged.|next|The causes for that are still being researched. But unless another "Day of Awakening" happens, it will be difficult |line|to study the changes.|next|However, it's been concluded lesser bugs have become more ferocious and will attack bugs that come near them.
The Everlasting Sapling@It is said that the sapling was a creation of the roaches.|next|The legends of the saplings have brought the first settlers to Bugaria,|line|bringing upon the creation of the |line|Ant Kingdom.|next|According to legends, it is said that eating even one of its leaves will grant immortality to the bug that eats it.|next|Our only clue to its whereabouts are artifacts mentioned in ancient texts.|next|They say one resides in Snakemouth Den, but its dangers have |line|proven too much to conquer.|next|Was it truly made by the Roaches? Could it have caused the Roaches to vanish?|next|I hope this chapter of history will be cleared up in my lifetime.
Snakemouth Den@Rumors say that during Elizant I's rule, roaches that lived in Snakemouth Den were faced with a sudden demise.|next|In one night, all the roaches that lived there were gone, and fungi monsters appeared.|next|Expeditions sent have always suffered losses, so the search for |line|the reason was put on hold.|next|Snakemouth Den is rumored to be a host to many Ancient Crystals. Could that be the cause?
A Brief History of Bees@The Bees are close allies with the Ants, and came in shortly after Elizant I settled down in these lands.|next|While they used to make honey themselves, technological advancements |line|made robotic drones slowly |line|take over the honey's production.|next|Many bees of the newer generation, barring scholars, do not fully understand how to make it.|next|Their society is mostly composed of females, with males residing in the |line|Queen's chambers.
A Brief History of Wasps@Although they've been around long before Elizant I's arrival, the Wasps live just outside of Bugaria. Thus, the Ants hold the title of first settlers.|next|They control most of the northern territory composing of the Far Grasslands and Wild Swamplands, and will attack anyone they catch intruding.|next|Due to a history of internal conflict, even the young are well-versed in military tactics and combat.
A Brief History of Termites@The Termites, like the Wasps, lived in these lands before Elizant I, and like them, live just outside of Bugaria.|next|An isolationist society, they say the Termites were close allies of the Roaches and as such possess advanced technology within their dome.|next|Unlike Bees and Ants, the Termites possess both male and female soldiers |line|and workers in their society.|next|They are also very good builders and know how to use clay well.
The Roaches@The roaches are the oldest of the bugs that rose after what they call the Day of Awakening.|next|Having mastered the art of crystals, their civilization rose on top of this abundant power source.|next|However, they suddenly disappeared.|line|Many have speculated on the reason.|next|Popular sentiment is some sort of civil war must've led their civilization to crumble.|next|Personally, I doubt it. Surely some would have remained, then?|next|If some roaches did survive, they live far from Bugaria. Perhaps not even they would know of what their ancestors did.
The Lost Art of Flight@History tells of insects soaring the sky, covering great distances.|next|Nowadays, only the bees, wasps and a few lesser species seem to retain that privilege.|next|Even so, most bugs continue to possess wings.|next|Day to day life doesn't quite need flight, so perhaps we as a collective have evolved past it.|next|Could it be, that one day bees will not flap their wings any longer?
Mantid Claws?@According to data found in ancient roach slabs, mantises used to have claws instead of hands before the Day of Awakening.|next|What a weird way to live, how would they be able to hold stuff to make art, or even cook nowadays?|next|Thinking about it, this might be why they have an affinity for sharp tools. Fascinating.|next|Some lesser mantids and mimics still have claws instead of hands. Such a pity.
The Ancient Crystals@Many crystals exist around the world, filled with a mysterious power.|next|The old roaches learned how to harness their magic, and crystals are now used as power sources for many machinery and other things.|next|No current side effects from crystal exposure are known, making them |line|relatively safe.|next|Some children's tales mention that sometimes sounds can be heard |line|from them if in a quiet enough place. Probably fake.|next|Archeologists say these crystals appeared at the same time the Day of Awakening started, suggesting a |line|link between them and that event.
Family Structures in Social Bugs@Bugs can be classified into two types: Social, and loners.|next|Social bugs usually have a single Queen, the mother of the colony.|next|Although all individuals are siblings, they do not tend to see it that way.|next|Some individuals grow closer to others by choice, creating their own |line|small "family cell".|next|Social bugs are separated into workers or civilians.|next|Workers are born to protect and take care of running the colony.|next|Workers take their job very seriously and will fulfill their |line|duties the best they can.|next|Recently, some workers have rebelled to lead a loner life. |line|This too, could be an evolution?|next|Civilians form family bonds more easily, and care for the general well-being of their colony.|next|It should be noted that social bugs referring to their Queen as "mother" is considered a taboo.|next|The Queen, however, has freedom to call others their children.
Bugarian Honey@Something about the pollen collected from Bugarian flowers causes |line|the honey produced here to be |line|super sweet, but also super volatile.|next|If the honey is mixed too thick or heated up too much, it becomes alive |line|and turns into a being called an "Abomihoney".|next|Scientists are still trying to figure out what causes the honey to turn into these beasts.|next|Many tests point towards crystal fragments in the plants of Bugaria |line|being the culprit, but there's no |line|conclusive proof.
Berries as Currency@It is unknown how long bugs have been using these specific types of berries as currency, but it is a very effective method.|next|Hard, long lasting and very bitter, these berries are almost never eaten for their horrible taste. Their small size is perfect for carrying them around, too!|next|There have been recorded cases of some bugs actually enjoying eating these berries, but almost no one can stomach their taste.
Dark Cherries@There are some rare berries in Bugaria that are worth a lot. A LOT!|line|We call them Dark Cherries.|next|A red counterpart has been found in the Eastern Lands, but due to how common they are, they aren't as sought |line|after.|next|The dark variants strangely seem to only grow underground. Meanwhile, the red ones grow in tall trees...|next|In any case, some bugs have a keen sense of smell for Dark Cherries. They're hired to find them so that they may be sold to collectors.
The Era Of Deceit@After the Day of Awakening, not all bugs stood equal in society.|next|Many ants, bees, wasps and others failed to evolve with the rest.|next|Many long disputes and frustration occurred because of this.|next|Thankfully, with the passing of time, all bugs experienced the Awakening. 
Youngling Care@Since the Day of Awakening we mature faster, but our infant stage is still critical.|next|There can be events where the caterpillar or grub stages get interrupted, causing unforeseen consequences.|next|If one is not careful, the youngling can turn into a dangerous lesser bug!|next|Nurseries must be protected and treasured at all costs, so that our future generations don't suffer such a fate.
A Study of Magic@Magic is uncommon, and few bugs are able to use it. Some bees theorize that crystal exposure can grant magic powers, but testing yearns no fruit.|next|A legendary wizard that lived in these lands used to experiment with crystals to learn their magic properties.|next|But he suddenly disappeared, and all knowledge of how crystals relate to magic disappeared with him.|next|Rumors have said that he might be living in the Far Grasslands, but no traces of him have been located.
The Mother Crystal@Deep underground below the Forsaken Lands, it is said a |line|massive crystal resides.|next|Said crystal might be linked to why Bugaria is such a haven in this area.|next|The ancient Roach texts suggest it fell from the heavens during the Day of Awakening, piercing the earth.|next|They said the crystal's aura protects Bugaria from the outside world's |line|great perils.|next|Some say that it is tied to Goddess Venus, the local deity of the Golden Settlement.|next|Although, personally, I would prefer not to speculate using local folklore.|next|Further study is necessary, but the Termites prohibit anyone from digging |line|under the Forsaken Lands.|next|Until relations between the kingdoms improve, reaching the crystal is currently impossible.
The Dead Lands@The gigantic feral beasts that surround Bugaria...it's uncanny |line|how we've gotten used to them.|next|Elizant I braved the Dead Lands, riddled with those creatures, to ensure |line|our peace.|next|Although Bugaria's protected by the Mother Crystal...|next|I struggle to write when I think of what could happen should that crystal lose its power.
The Northern Kingdom@Far beyond the swamplands lay the Northern Kingdom, home to mostly many kind of beetles.|next|They are very traditionalist and hold honor above all else, however many travel to Bugaria to escape the Dead Landers' attacks.|next|The trip to Bugaria is hard enough. But the north houses the swamps, filled with more dangerous creatures.|next|To avoid the Wasps' hostility, most take the long route around their Kingdom. It's the most insane of trips.|next|Truly, the lives of the northerners isn't an easy one...
The Eastern Lands@To the far east of Bugaria, lay the Dead Lands we fear so much.|next|Monsters everywhere, and a feeling of utter dread.|next|Who knows how, but I braved through the odds. Eventually, I |line|reached the Eastern Kingdom.|next|It is so different compared to Bugaria... It has many exotic fruits and materials that cannot be found |line|in our kingdom.|next|Many of its denizens live in a very closed community that shuns outsiders.|next|The only exception to this seems to be a rare species of bug that resembles|line|fruits.|next|Although friendly, other Eastern bugs appear to stay clear of them.|line|Is their smell too sweet?|next|If I don't make it back to Bugaria, I'm glad I got to meet them...
The Giants@Every day, more ancient artifacts pop up.|next|Given their size and unknown purpose, scholars believe "Giants" |line|roamed these lands.|next|They could have existed all over the known world, in giant kingdoms to protect them from the Dead Lands.|next|When the "Day of Awakening" happened, the Giants must have vanished. Only their artifacts remain.|next|There's no way to know, is there? Maybe they caused the awakening themselves.|next|Perhaps they fell to the Dead Lands, or created them themselves.|next|Maybe someday they will return to reclaim their old home? Maybe they |line|have left for another world?|next|I'm a bug of facts, but even I am reduced to daydreaming about their fate.|next|At least we have their monuments, showing us glimpses of days past.
The Day of Reckoning@The following cannot be confirmed, having been retrieved from a book in a Roach Village's ruins.|next|According to this book written by Rodrick the Roach Scholar...|next|What we call the "Day of Awakening", the Roaches called |line|the "Day of Reckoning".|next|It was an event where they "woke up to the world".|next|They share our belief that before that day, we were not different from the lesser bugs amongst us.|next|A cataclysm happened suddenly, which banished the once fabled Giants to another world. Only bugs and some other creatures were left in this world.|next|After said cataclysm, the roaches became sentient, giving birth to civilization.|next|Other books by Rodrick mention fires raining down from the sky and destroying the earth.|next|Expeditions have not found craters or traces of such a disaster.|next|Its constant mention in Roach texts suggests it was a big part of their culture.|next|Or could it be a religious creation myth?|next|Rodrick...were you lying? How are we supposed to find out!? Curses...|next|I'll keep this book hidden away, until I can find the truth.|next|I'll head into the Eastern Lands once more, if I have to.
