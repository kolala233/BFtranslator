Zombiant@Zombiants are a popular folk tale, a story told to children to keep them from venturing into caves.|line||halfline|Disturbing reports have shown that Snakemouth Den seems to be inhabited with|line|the real thing.|line||halfline|Caution is advised while thorough investigation is held.@Eep! That Ant is...possessed!|line|No way!|next|That's just a story the Queen tells kids to scare them... This is too creepy!|next|I'm gonna take it out!@By Venus... That Ant walks after its passing! A "Zombiant"!|next|I truly believed they were nothing more than a myth.|next|It is my duty as a fellow explorer...to end its suffering!@Cordyceps. It seems it picked an Ant as its host. How weird, that it would attack us.|next|It's nothing special, our attacks should take it out quickly.
Jellyshroom@Data on this species is anecdotal, as it's a new organism discovered by a trio of explorers in Snakemouth Den.|halfline||line|It camouflages itself as a regular shroom, and it attacks nearby beings it feels threatened by.@Cripes, is that a flying Mushroom? This cave does some weird |unpauseline|stuff to things...|next|I'll knock it out of the air!@By the Queen...! What an abomination.|next|I cannot hurt this beast while it is airborne.|next|Vi, would you lend me your strength?@Huh. Mushrooms get crazier by the day.|next|Although some of our skills could finish it off quickly... Vi, help save us some TP.
Spider@The ender of journeys, this vicious Spider made Snakemouth Den its hunting ground while guarding an ancient artifact.|line||halfline|Seemingly immortal, it haunted the cave for countless moons before being defeated by a trio of explorers.{Although it is now gone, the stories of bugs trapped in its web will haunt explorers forever.@This Spider...just gets scarier the more I look at it. But I'm not going to run away this time!|next|I'll knock it out of the sky whenever it climbs up its web.|next|Let's beat it up and get that treasure!@We meet again...you vicious affront to bugkind.|next|For all the suffering you've caused, I...no, WE will see to your end!|next|I'll rely on the others to knock the beast down when I can't reach it. And |unpauseline|use my skills to protect them from |unpauseline|damage!@This may be unbecoming of us but... After so long, we're going |unpauseline|to get revenge.|next|For all the time we spent inside that cocoon...you will suffer tenfold!|next|As long as Vi keeps it knocked down, we will attack it without a hint |unpauseline|of mercy!
Zasp@One of the few Wasps to be accepted into the Ant Kingdom, Zasp hunts for treasure like many other explorers.|line||halfline|His allegiances and motives are completely centered around Mothiva.|line||halfline|When she's not around, he loosens up a bit.@Hmph. So you really want to fight, Zasp? Bet you think you'll win cuz |unpauseline|you're all cool. And tall.|next|Prepare for a Beemerang to the face!@Zasp, we are fellow explorers... Why must we fight!?|next|As much as it pains me, I won't let you get in our way!@Fancy fighting you here, Zasp. You've already lost to us in eating, |unpauseline|and now you'll lose in combat.|next|We hope you'll enjoy the bitter chill of defeat!
Cactiling@A member of the Seedling family, these plants evolved a hard shell with spikes to protect themselves from travelers and creatures scavenging for food in the Lost Sands.|line||halfline|This shell also helps them retain water in their bodies for long periods of time.{They can shoot out their spikes for projectile attacks, and also use them to ram into enemies, causing piercing damage.|line||halfline|The spikes grow back very quickly, and sometimes travelers harvest them to make|line|weapons and other goods.@Seriously? This is a Seedling!? I just don't get science sometimes...|next|It's a bit too tough for the Beemerang... Better let Kabbu handle it!@Incredible... I truly believed this to be a cactus. What an impressive disguise!|next|Still, if it stands in our way, I shall flip it over. Let's go, team!@Seriously? There's no way anyone would fall for such a cheap disguise. |unpauseline|We're almost offended.|next|Our ice magic will put in some work, as soon as Kabbu flips it over.
Psicorp@The rustling sound of scattering sand warns travelers of the presence of a Psicorp.|line||halfline|Its claws can poison or sedate, depending on the situation.|line||halfline|Prey gets sedated, and predators poisoned. Travelers, unfortunately, are subject|line|to both.@Hmm... So this is a Psicorp. I think their poison can make some nice items!|next|Let's not beat it up too bad, or no one will buy it! Leif! Get it out if it |unpauseline|goes under!@...I never did like these blasted Psicorps. Leif, use your magic to |unpauseline|unearth them!|next|We must be careful, for they may feint before striking us with poison or |unpauseline|sedatives!@This creature...it gives us an ominous feeling. We never were |unpauseline|a fan of sedatives.|next|It is otherwise unimpressive. Not even digging will spare it from our magic. Let's decimate it.
Thief@These Dragonfly thieves lurk within the Lost Sands. The buzz their wings produce while flying hinders their sneakiness, yet their Mug Tackle is 100% effective.|line||halfline|Voted the cutest members of the desert bandits, the other members make sure the Dragonflies eat first during times of scarcity.@A thief!? There's nothing worse in the world! The nerve to steal my hard-earned treasure!|next|I'm gonna knock 'em out of the air and take everything he's stolen!@Darn! That flying thief keeps stealing my favorite snacks! And I can't reach him at all...|next|Quick, team! We must defeat him before he uses them for himself!@Adorable. We've never seen a flying thief before. He steals food before anything else.|next|Maybe if we give him enough of Kabbu's snacks, he will join us?|next|...Let's defeat him quickly.
Bandit@These Cricket bandits spark fear amongst all caravans traveling through the harsh desert.|line||halfline|They are ruthless and efficient, and they have no intent to negotiate.|line||halfline|They change completely when amongst their brethren. They act like older siblings to the Dragonflies, and even enjoy gardening.@Eep! I-It's a bandit! I'm not gonna let him get near our bag. No way!|next|Maybe I'll just let Kabbu take the hits while I throw my Beemerang at 'em.|next|W-Wait... What if they steal my Beemerang? I hope I'm not worrying |line|too much...@Hmph, a Cricket bandit. It has been a long time since we encountered each other.|next|Be ready, you rascal. My strength is far greater than you remember!@So this is a bandit. Can't say we've seen one before. Times must have gotten rough.|next|As long as we deal with them quickly, we have no need to worry over our possessions. Let's freeze it in its tracks.
Inichas@The Inichas is a multi-legged caterpillar covered in sturdy, spiky armor.|line||halfline|It's in the early stages of its life, and it was supposed to become a Butterfly.|line||halfline|However, the strange atmosphere in Snakemouth Den altered it in weird ways: it will forever be a violent, irrational caterpillar.@What's up with this thing? It's like a spiky Pillbug!|next|Its armor is really strong, so I can barely hurt it.|next|I bet Kabbu can flip it over, though!@An Inichas, this spiky bug is still in its larval stage.|next|Although it has impressive armor, it stands no chance against my horn!@This...thing is really annoying. Ice feels like it should pierce the armor, but it doesn't.|next|Kabbu, flip this nuisance.
Seedling@The common Seedling, characterized by the rectangular flower adorning its head, is one of the most common species in the world.|line||halfline|They are tenacious and have a huge appetite, which they sate by devouring farmers' crops.{They can use the flower on their heads to fly. Although it can be ripped out, it grows back within a week.@It's one of those stupid, annoying Seedlings!|next|They're all over the outskirts, but don't even drop good items!|next|Let's just beat them up already!@Hmm, it seems this land has Seedlings as well.|next|Despite their adorable looks, they plague many fields and have no qualms devouring crops.|next||librarybreak|Although weak and puny in comparison to me, their flying variation is troublesome, as I can't reach it...|next|I'll have to ask Vi for help.@What a...cute creature. It's almost a shame that we must fight it.|next|Our basic ice magic cannot reach it while it is flying. Guess Vi'll have to bring it down.|next||librarybreak|Hmm... Perhaps we could keep one as a pet? Vi would have lots of fun taking care of it.

Numbnail@This one-eyed snail travels slowly across the Golden region. It used to be hunted by bugkind due to the usefulness of its shell, and the good taste of its meat.|line||halfline|To combat this, it developed sedative laser eyes to fend off its many predators, and they've mostly been left alone in recent times.{History books use it as the reference point for commodities becoming luxuries.@Ooh, a Numbnail! I hear Numbnail sedatives go for a lot of berries |unpauseline|on the market.|next|I'll try to take some for myself when Kabbu flips it out of its shell!@Oh, isn't this a Numbnail? I've read that it is quite the endangered species! Perhaps we should flee and leave |unpauseline|it alone...|next|But if we are left with no other choice, I will bring it out of its shell! |unpauseline|Take care with its sedating attacks!@What a hideous snail. It's all slimy and disgusting.|next|It's stubborn too, going into its shell when under our attacks.|next|Maybe Kabbu can draw it out? Let's make sure to not be hit by its sedatives.
Mothiva@One of Bugaria's most famous idols, Mothiva also works as an explorer.|line||halfline|Despite the friendly appearance she gives off to the public, she is ruthless and ambitious.|line||halfline|Together with Zasp, she has no qualms being unethical to reach her goals.@Tch. I don't even know why I got excited to meet her. She's just another pretentious, snotty bug!|next|I've gotta be careful hitting her though, Zasp gets really mad!@Mothiva... You are respected and adored by so many! It pains me |unpauseline|so to see your true colors...|next|Let's defeat her, and then take care of Zasp!@Well, if we didn't care for her shows before, this certainly ain't helping.|next|We should probably knock her out first, even if Zasp gets mad. Let's wrap |unpauseline|this up.
Acornling@To protect themselves from the many predators in the Golden Hills, these Seedlings|line|gave up their ability to fly for a hard outer shell.|line||halfline|This doesn't stop Acornlings from being attacked, but their survival rates have gone up massively.@Seriously? A Seedling with a hat!?|next|My Beemerang can't pierce through...|line|Kabbu's gonna have to flip it!@What a sturdy little creature! Its appearance truly betrays its resilience!|next|But alas... It will be no match for my horn!@Honestly... Seedlings are way cuter. And less annoying to deal with, too.|next|Let's team up with Kabbu and freeze it while it's flipped.
Weevil@Rumored to be closely related to Beetles, these predators are often found searching the Golden region for food.|line||halfline|They are herbivores, but will attack nearby bugs should they be disturbed.|line||halfline|Some claim to have tamed Weevils as loyal partners, but these claims haven't been confirmed.@E-Eep! A Weevil! I don't have the best memories of them...|next|L-Let's get Kabbu to take the hits, while we beat them up!@A Weevil! Such a ferocious beast... It attacks anything that moves!|next|I've heard they can even increase their own power... We must end this battle quickly!@Whoa, easy there... This beast doesn't look like it can be reasoned with.|next|It's quite fierce, too. We should discipline it before it can give us much |unpauseline|trouble.
Mr. Tester@YAMEROOOOO@beetattle@beetletattle@Isn't this too meta?
Venus' Bud@According to Acolyte Aria, these sturdy plants are part of the Harvest Goddess, Venus.|line||halfline|They have amazing healing properties, and will always support the denizens of the Golden Hills when possible.{They can also shoot pollen capable of making the liveliest of bugs fall asleep.|line||halfline|When angered, they are able to take flight, and will shoot their pollen nonstop.|line||halfline|They can even heal their own wounds as long as they are rooted... Their truly divine properties require further study.@Hey, this is a Venus' Bud! I saw them in a storybook once...|next|I wonder if they drop any rare items? I could get rich proving they're |unpauseline|real!|next||librarybreak|...But maybe they'll get mad if they find out I hurt it... Bleh. Less |unpauseline|thinking, more fighting!@These beings... They are similar to Goddess Venus. This hill is truly sacred ground.|next|Still, the fact they fly when I strike them...is a bit cruel. I need to get a |unpauseline|weapon for these situations...@There's something off about this creature... We can't help but feel it's |unpauseline|a shell...|next|How unsettling... While it's on the ground, we'll make sure to |unpauseline|target it.
Chomper@These vicious plants see bugs as meals and roam the Golden region.|line||halfline|They're always looking for their next snack, and tourists must be wary of them.|line||halfline|Although small, they can quickly multiply if left alone. They must never be underestimated.@Chompers are the worst! They bite you really hard, and even heal while doing it!|next|And then they summon tinier, annoying Chompers! I'm gonna take |unpauseline|it out before it can!@Chompers... They reproduce quickly and eat voraciously with their sharp teeth...|next|I will strike them down, before they can heal by biting us!@This thing... It's kinda funny, isn't it? Just the way it dances. The little ones it |unpauseline|summons are even funnier.|next|Its bites heal it, though... We'll destroy it quickly with ice magic.
Acolyte Aria@One of Venus' acolytes, Aria spends her time in the Golden Settlement, preaching the words of Venus herself.|line||halfline|She prays in order to summon vines, which she can use to attack or to propel herself for a nasty kick.@What the heck? You're telling me prayer lets Aria summon huge vines!?|next|Maybe I should start praying too... Meh. I'll just use my Beemerang |unpauseline|to hit her while she's up in the air!@Acolyte Aria...I cannot believe how much power her faith has bestowed |unpauseline|upon her.|next|Her vine platform is troublesome. I'll cut it down if I must!@Impressive. We thought Aria was just an obsessed preacher but...|next|To be able to fight this well is commendable. Still, we'll make sure to |unpauseline|freeze |libraryline|the vines she summons!
Vine@jk jk. wE cAN't sTOp yOU AnYMOre!@beetattle@beetletattle@mothtattle
Kabbu@An unfortunate battle caused by very alluring pheromones.|line||halfline|Kabbu would prefer it never be spoken of again.@You're in big trouble, Kabbu! I'm super mad!|next|...B-But I don't wanna hurt you! I need to think of another way!@...I can't believe I did that...@Tch. Chemistry be darned. Kali! This trick is beyond despicable!|next|Kabbu's...our friend. We must seek an alternative to this.
Venus' Guardian@This fearsome beast was created by Venus for a combat trial using a sunflower as its base.|line||halfline|It had many abilities such as flight, seed cannons, and sheer strength.{To top it off, the Goddess herself increased its abilities during the battle.|line||halfline|If Venus created this beast in mere moments, there is no telling what her true|line|powers could do with more preparation.@S-So big... That's one ugly face!|next|But it kinda smells like pollen. It's really distracting... |unpauseline|Gah! Leif, just hit it already!@To be challenged by the Goddess... Am I really worthy?|next|...No matter. I will cut through its defenses. For the artifact, and for Leif!@What a hideous beast... Very unlike Venus.|next|It's the only thing standing between us and our answers. We'll strike it |unpauseline|down!
Wasp Trooper@These foot soldiers from the Wasp Kingdom follow their King's orders obsessively. Even when losing, they will go down fighting.|line||halfline|Wasps are trained to be soldiers when they become of age, but these are exceptional even amongst them.@What's the Wasp Kingdom's problem? Why'd they have to walk |unpauseline|in and start causing trouble!?|next|Grr...I'm gonna teach him a lesson!@The Wasp Kingdom... What could possibly justify sending soldiers |unpauseline|to attack Bugaria?|next|For now, I'll focus on making sure they bring us no harm!@This Wasp Trooper... We wonder if he's vile, or just following orders...|next|Regardless, if it's going to shake the peace, we'll freeze him in his tracks!
Wasp Bomber@These physically frail Wasps contribute to the war effort by supporting other troops from the back.|line||halfline|Equipped with a vast array of bombs, they try to end the battle with firepower before being targeted.@Stop it! Stop chucking stuff at us! I can't even knock down those boxes...|next|Kabbu, if you flip it twice I can bring down the smackdown!@Tch. A long-range, defensive enemy. It seems tailored to make my life difficult.|next|Yet I have the best shot of breaking through its defenses...|line|I won't let my team down!@Wonder if this is how enemies feel when we shoot ice from behind everyone. |unpauseline|It must be this annoying.|next|If we manage to flip it over, we should be able to deal with it quickly.
Wasp Driller@Part of the Wasp Elite, these drillers are as cunning as they are powerful.|line||halfline|They've mastered many battle tactics utilizing their drills, both offensive and|line|defensive.|line||halfline|Should a general fall, they're the first in line to be promoted.@W-Whoa there, big guy! I almost got run through...|next|He gets tougher when I hit 'em. Nothing Kabbu can't handle! Err, I hope.@The Wasps have some truly fearsome soldiers in their ranks! |unpauseline|Hopefully not too many others.|next|But we can do this, team. I'll break his guard as soon as it's raised!@Is this truly a soldier? He seems more skilled than his |unpauseline|general. That drill's not for show.|next|He seems to go on the defensive when struck, so we'd best leave Kabbu free to deal with that.
Wasp Scout@Do not be fooled by this soldier's petite figure. Wasp Scouts are just as deadly and vicious as the rest of the army.|line||halfline|Using their prowess in flight, they honor their name by scouting ahead to ensure a smooth operation.@Whoa, he's fast! Okay... Focus, Vi! You've gotta aim super well if you're gonna win!|next|We can't let him call for more friends!@Scoundrel! I will give you a chance to retreat before Vi knocks you down... No? Then face our wrath!|next|Even if you call for reinforcements, |unpauseline|we won't falter!@We don't need your annoying buzzing in our ears. You won't |unpauseline|be able to call for backup while frozen!|next|We'll make sure to send you flying back to your King, trapped inside an ice cube!
Midge@Midges are said to be distant relatives of Mosquitoes, but making that comparison is a|line|quick way to get in a fight.|line||halfline|Usually found in caves, Midges hunt together and will protect each other when a member of their pack is attacked.{They can use their proboscises to suck fluids from their prey, recovering from any damage received extremely quickly.|line||halfline|Said proboscis also doubles as a sharp weapon, which they will not shy away from using to pierce enemies.@Ugh! I've got stings everywhere! It just keeps hitting me back!|next|I should try to take it out in one attack!@Midges... Their stings get so itchy!|next|But even so...I should draw in their group attacks so Vi can knock them all down safely!@These creatures... When we hit one, the rest gang up on us.|next|We should try freezing them all at once, to see what they'll do then.
Underling@Aggressive without provocation, this Seedling variant creates confusion amongst|line|scholars.|line||halfline|Despite evolving in an area without predators and have abundant food, they|line|have developed short tempers and even poisonous attacks.{Even more ironically, they've become delicious when cooked.|line||halfline|Researchers won't stop until they figure out why this creature evolved to make its own life more difficult.@These Seedlings BURROW? Ugh, it's gotta be karma for all those flying Seedlings. Help me out, Leif!@Dear Venus, must we truly deal with such stubborn and irritable creatures?|next|I could try to dig after it myself, but... We'll have to rely on Leif to unearth it instead!@Ah, this must be the Underling that the chefs tend to mention. Poisonous, but sweet.|next|If it digs under, we'll use magic to bring it up. Let's try to capture one...for |unpauseline|research.
Monsieur Scarlet@A vile, flirty criminal who escaped the public eye for many moons.|line||halfline|He would post pleas for help in quest boards, and then drain the life from explorers who would come to help.|line||halfline|Thanks to Team Celia and Team Snakemouth, his face has become known. He|line|has since gone missing to escape pursuit.@We've got that jerk right where we want him! But yikes... That umbrella hurts |unpauseline|a lot!|next|And it heals him too! It's super annoying... |libraryline|We'll have to go all out!@Scarlet! How dare you hurt our comrades, and attack so many others!|next|Using your looks to allure innocent explorers, draining their lives with your attacks...! We will bring you to justice, |unpauseline|fiend!@Tch. What a despicable criminal. We could respect his skill, if not for our |unpauseline|distaste of him.|next|We must attack at full strength to offset his cumbersome healing!
Golden Seedling@The infamous Golden Seedling shows up in tales across generations despite its rarity.|line||halfline|Said to bring the best of luck and wealth to those who find it, many have expended their time and savings hunting for|line|them.{Despite its appearance, it is nimble and powerful. One must take care when going for|line|the prize!@WOAH! A GOLDEN SEEDLING! Their Tangy Berries sell for DOZENS!|next|Heheheh... We're gonna be rich! ...W-What!? What's this defense!? |line|Only my first hit's working!|next|We've gotta find a way to stop it from running!@INCREDIBLE! This is the Golden Seedling of LEGENDS! It brings fortune, health, and love if one can best it!|next|It has unholy defenses...! Not even my piercing horn is getting through!|next|I need to think of a way to prevent its escape while |unpauseline|we whittle it down!@So this is a Golden Seedling. Such inviting colors, and cute demeanor! |line|We'll be blessed to capture and raise one.|next|Hmm? It's resisting even our ice magic? So it's powerful, too...|next||librarybreak|We must make sure it doesn't escape until it is subdued!
Arrow Worm@The Arrow Worm is the most hated pest of the Lost Sands, annoying villagers and bandits alike.|line||halfline|Its sharp teeth can cut through many strong materials, leaving many homes with|line|more windows than they need.|line||halfline|Explorer efforts have been made to lower their numbers, with moderate success.@That's an Arrow Worm, right? It's buried all the time, so I can't be super |unpauseline|sure...|next|Oi Leif! Get it out of the ground or we're gonna have to book it out of here!@If I remember correctly, this local beast always stays beneath the sand waiting to |libraryline|devour prey.|next|Its teeth are so sharp that they can bite through stone! Leif, we will need your |libraryline|assistance!@Our enemy is rustling sand? ...Just kidding. It seems to be a buried sand-dwelling worm of some kind.|next|Our ice magic should take care of it before it can bite us!
Carmina@A master of all games, Carmina loves playing for keeps, building wealth and outsmarting her opponents.|line||halfline|Taunts and rule-sharking are all fair game, although she'd never cheat.|line||halfline|On Metal Island, she had a hostile encounter with Team Snakemouth after they barged into her room uninvited.@L-Look, we didn't know your room was here! We're sorry!|next|...All of her attacks are kinda random, so I don't know what to expect. Hope we get lucky!@Surely there is a better solution to this? We...we could clean your room for a week? ...No?|next|Hnngh... Everyone, stay alert. We have no idea how fortune will affect her attacks!@Who DOESN'T get insurance nowadays? Guess being rich |line|doesn't make you smart.|next|Ah, crud. She heard us. Let's see where that roulette lands...
Seedling King@The few Seedlings who survive much longer than anyone expected them to are crowned as wise and powerful rulers.|line||halfline|This confidence boost actually mutates the Seedling, granting it incredible power and resilience.{Kings can create other Seedling species from Tangy Berries that grow around their "crown".|line||halfline| These lead shorter yet incredibly devoted lives. It's recommended to clear them all |line|out while battling a King.@GRR! So YOU'RE the source of all those dumb Seedlings!|next|Oi, I'm talking to you! Stop spawning more!|next|...They just keep coming. We've gotta finish this fast!@By the Golden Settlement's Clear Water... Seedlings can mature into such behemoths!?|next|It's constantly spawning reinforcements, stopping me |unpauseline|from reaching it.|next|I'll do my best to clear those small ones, while my team attacks from a distance!@Oh dear. A King-sized Seedling. Hey, Vi. Can we keep i-...?! What? No?!|next|But it keeps spawning mini-Seedlings! It's a cuteness factory! |line|...|wavy|Sigh|wavy|, alright.|next|Let's try to keep the small ones at bay while we defeat this one.
Broodmother@This electrically charged Mama Midge was drawn to the Golden Settlement's power plant.|line||halfline|Absorbing energy to her heart's content, she caused several power outages while setting up her nest.{Bee soldiers were tasked with removing her nest after her defeat, but many soldiers felt the task was a tad cruel.@Ow! Sto--...!|anim,0,Hurt||fwait,1.2||anim,0,Flustered| S-Stop it! I'm tired of getting numbed!|next||anim,0,BattleIdle|Grr... We gotta stop the small ones from attacking so we can take care of this one!@Mother of horns! It...it itches. But its numbing does not let me scratch! What cruelty!|next|If we are to survive, we must block perfectly. Remember, Midges react |line|to their comrades' pain!@This is the absolute worst thing we've had to fight. A constant |line|barrage of numbing stings...|next|Let's freeze up the small ones, see if it takes some pressure off us.
Plumpling@This Seedling has adapted to the Forsaken Lands, sacrificing cuteness and speed|line|for power and monstrous defense.|line||halfline|Although some say it is delicious, the truth is it's almost impossible to take a bite out of it.@...Alright then. This ain't good. It's fat and way too sturdy! If I'm gonna hurt it I'll need some piercing skills...|next|I think I'll have to rely on Kabbu and Leif for this one...@This humongous creature sports armor soldiers would be most envious of! My horn can only barely hurt it, even when I'm at the front...|next|It may be wise to save our skills for this behemoth.@Ugh, it's hideous. And it's got some defense... |libraryline|We can barely hurt it |unpauseline|even if we give it our all.|next|Kabbu's probably the best one for this job. Hope we don't waste too |unpauseline|many skills...
Flowerling@These flying Seedlings embody friendship, co-dependence, and cute things.|line||halfline|Completely awful at fighting, they've struck a deal with the local creatures: in exchange for support, it will be protected.|line||halfline|As an unexpected side effect, creatures fight each other to become its partner.@I wonder how many Seedling types there are... This one's really weak!|line|Guess it needs others to fight its battles...|next|Kabbu said to focus it, but I'd rather leave it for last. Hmm...@Curse you, adorable yet levitating foe! Must you hover so insultingly close to my horn's range!?|next|It supports its allies in many ways... It may be worth asking Vi to eliminate it first!@What a cute little Seedling. It'd fit right in along with the rest of our team, wouldn't it?|next|Seems it doesn't want to join us, though... Guess we'd best knock it down |unpauseline|gently to |libraryline|stop its supporting moves.
Burglar@These Ladybugs turned to crime after their exile, doing little to improve their already poor reputation.|line||halfline|They still dream of returning to the Ant Kingdom, despite their crimes.|line||halfline|It's undeniable, however, that their actions only make that dream stray further away.@Ugh... This is bad. Burglars are the worst! I can't believe how fast they can |unpauseline|tackle, being so big...|next|They're tough and good at stealing too... I hate them! Let's finish this quick!@This burglar... Must he be like this? Have Ladybugs not been tarnished enough?|next|We can't afford to feel sorry for him, though, for he is fast and strong... We must stay firm and fight back!@Burglars... It's a shame how Bugaria seems so unsafe these days...|next|We won't show mercy. We'll teach them a lesson they won't forget.
Astotheles@The leader of the Lost Sands' bandits, Astotheles lives by an ironic code of honor.|line||halfline|He vanishes and appears without notice, his every mission dedicated to improve life in his hideout.{It is said he wishes to establish his own country. But with the list of his crimes only increasing, this becomes unlikelier every day.|line||halfline|But at the end of the day, the love and loyalty of his bandit family is enough for him.@You crook! What if I'd never found my Beemerang!? And what's with ruining my |libraryline|items?|next|I don't care if you're the boss, you're gonna go down!@What mastery of the blade, even with just one arm! It reminds me of Maki's strength.|next|With lightning speed he crushes our items... |libraryline|We must make this a quick bout!@Honor... What a joke of a request, coming from one who leads thieves.|next|Break our items if you want. You're going to pay for imprisoning |unpauseline|us all the same!
Mother Chomper@A Chomper that grew in extremely fertile soil and was exposed to just the right amount of light.|line||halfline|She spawns endless Chompers to bring food to her, as she cannot move her roots.|line||halfline|Despite that flaw, she is strong beyond belief and can devour bugs in one bite.@Eep! I almost got eaten... This thing ain't messing around!|next|She keeps spitting Chompers out... I think I'm gonna beat her up first!@Ngh, what a formidable beast! And she brings endless reinforcements, as if she wasn't strong enough...|next|It'd be best to freeze the smaller Chompers, while we focus our efforts on |unpauseline|this monster!@What an incredible appetite this monster has... |libraryline|We can respect that.|next|Our ice magic should prove effective in stalling the smaller ones. |unpauseline|Then, we can take her down!
Ahoneynation@The worst case scenario, the most uncontainable disaster of poor honey mixing!|line||halfline|This rare sighting, capable of punching through steel, was contained by a brave group of explorers.@The factory shuts down for a few minutes, and THIS happens? Yikes... |unpauseline|Talk about escalating quickly.|next|We've gotta get rid of it, but we can't ignore the Abomihoneys, either!@By the sweet horns of legend! This honey's gone too far! It's supported by |unpauseline|smaller Abomihoneys, which is quite troublesome...|next|We must use our TP wisely to minimize the damage they can cause, |unpauseline|Leif!@Now that's a dessert if we've ever seen one. With little Abomihoneys on the side.|next|This could get out of hand quickly... We'd best make use |unpauseline|of our magic.
Bee-Boop@The Bee-Boop sports cutting edge propulsion systems, allowing it to patrol multiple areas, even those without footing.|line||halfline|The weaponry was an afterthought, but it gets the job done.@The heck? Who put blasters on the Bee-Boops? I'm gonna have to |line|knock 'em out of the sky!@Ngh, this machine taunts me with its advanced flight systems! But I'll show it the power of natural strength!@We thought Vi was tiny, but just look at that. When it's tumbled down, we'll shut it off for good.
Security Turret@This automated protector is the legacy of the previous generation's greatest inventor.|line||halfline|Although a bit outdated, it performs its job efficiently by firing powerful missiles to disarm intruders.|line||halfline|Efforts to replace it have been made, but nobody wants to provide the budget to accomplish it.@So annoying! You'd think they'd stop firing at me, since I'm a Bee and all... Let's pummel it!@That poor machine... It cannot move! We must defeat it, but...couldn't we just walk away from it?@Creating machines just to battle others... Not the best use of science. |line|Let's disassemble it.
Denmuki@These lesser caterpillars roam around the Honey Factory, attracted by the abundant electricity in the area.|line||halfline|They are able to store electricity in their bodies which they use to protect themselves from predators and the Bees.{While pests, they help regulate the excess energy the core releases now and then, so the Bees let them roam the factory while carefully avoiding their shocks.@Uh oh. Someone let the Denmukis out of their cage... We're gonna have to smack 'em before they zap us!@Denmukis! Their electrified fur can power gadgets for days! ...I hope it won't shock me. I despise being shocked.@Ouch... We got shocked trying to pet it. This critter seems to be quite charged.|next|We must block carefully, or we'll be getting numbed for real.
Heavy Drone B-33@The culmination of years of research, the Heavy Drone B-33 was created with a single purpose: protect the factory's core.|line||halfline|Although it was heavily damaged in combat, with some repairs it'll be back better|line|than ever, ready to serve the Bee Kingdom.@Malbee wasn't kidding on orientation day. This thing's super tough!|next|I'm gonna hit it tons of times, so it comes crashing down!@This poor robot... It's only doing its job. But we cannot back down!|next|I'll do my best to draw in its fire while Vi knocks it down!@Technology has advanced quite a bit. This is an impressive machine.|next|Vi can knock it down, but we must be wary of its delayed missiles. Our formation will be crucial.
Mender@These automated mechanical helpers are both adorable and extremely capable.|line||halfline|Their countless unpaid hours of support ensure the factory runs well while most Bees sleep.|line||halfline|Sometimes they get a bit wacky, but scientists assure their existentialism is nothing|line|more than glitches.@These things won't shut up! And they're super sturdy!|next|At least they don't fight back... Time to whack them!@This poor creature... Its wails of distress reach me to the core.|next|Maybe I should relay to let Vi and Leif deal with this...@These are way too cute. We should ask for one later. Maybe a plushie, even?|next|Shame there's not much to do other than beat them up...
Abomihoney@Under certain conditions not yet understood, the indiscriminate mixing of large amounts of honey can give birth to this beast.|line||halfline|It lives only to devour before it is consumed.@Argh! The Abomihoney! They mixed too much honey! We're in big trouble!|next|We've got to take it down, or freeze it before it explodes!@Goodness gracious, this is an affront to nature! It looks highly |unpauseline|unstable...|next|Leif, bring it out when it goes under. We must take it out with haste!@What a waste of honey... To think of all the meals this could've been.|next|If it pulls anything funny, we'll use our ice magic to deal with it. Let's end this.
Dune Scorpion@This rabid beast is the nightmare of all denizens of the desert. It strikes without reason, without mercy... It only wishes to cause violence.|line||halfline|Its stinger holds multiple poisons, and its strength is massive.|line||halfline|Upon sighting, do not fight - flee!@Watch out! ...Phew. Kabbu almost got wrecked!|next|This thing's way angrier than a Psicorp! We've got to knock |unpauseline|it out!@Oof! I barely dodged that... It's hard to speak when being assailed so violently!|next|And yet, it is my duty to draw its attacks in. Vi, Leif, let's do this together!@Impressive. Even though our ice pierces it, it barely reacts. This is bad.|next|We'll have to use all our strength, to make sure it goes down and stays down!
Tidal Wyrm@Stream Mountain's depths conceal a vast water network.|line||halfline|However, there is something else hidden beneath the currents... An aggressive beast |line|that devours explorers whole!|line||halfline|It takes advantage of the watery terrain, forcing bugs to fight it in flooded spaces.{Team Snakemouth managed to defeat it during the low tide season.|line||halfline|Thanks to them, no more dreams will get sunk while exploring this mountain.@B-Back off! I'm not your afternoon snack! Get ready to get sunk!|next|That tail's super buff, but it really does a number if we knock it down!@We're fortunate the tide is low. Otherwise, we couldn't reach this beast!|next|Its tail is worth weakening, but I'll need Vi and Leif to assist me!@There's too much water... We can't freeze it all. We'll have to deal |line|with this the old-fashioned way.|next|Its tail is constantly barraging us... We must make the time |unpauseline|to incapacitate it.
Kali@A talented seamstress who owns a shop in Defiant Root, Kali came from a foreign land to Bugaria to sell her homemade wares. |line||halfline|They are very popular amongst tourists that pass through the settlement.|line||halfline|She is also well known for her exotic dancing, something she learned in her homeland. {This dance is able to boost people's morales no matter what, making her a dazzling partner who supports her allies with various boosts. |line||halfline|She tends to panic and surrender when she's targeted, though. She can't risk damaging her hands!@I'm sorry about the vase, but you're going too far! Give Kabbu back!|next|Maybe if I knock her around a bit, she'll stop dancing and start listening!@I'd rather not say much about her...@Vi's put us in a real jam. Kali's more formidable than we ever expected.|next|Doesn't help she's boosting poor Kabbu. We should put an end to that.
Zombee@One of Snakemouth Lab's forgotten experiments. |line||halfline|The noble goal of creating a Bee with infinite stamina and strong wings quickly |libraryline|turned into a tragedy.@W-Whoa... Why're there Bees in here...!? This is awful!|next|Ugh! Leif...can you use your ice magic on them?@By Vi's translucent wings... What sort of unholy experiments have been conducted here!?|next|Leif, stay resolute! Your magic will be critical if we are to triumph!@Ngh...! This is not right. This feeling is...|next|F-Focus! We'll just freeze everything on the path to the truth!
Zombeetle@Poor kidnapped Beetles, who suffered unexpected side effects in Snakemouth's Lab.|line||halfline|The goal was to create a powerful Beetle who could dig to the other side of the world. The result was a fierce, violent monster.@No way... It wasn't just Zombiants! It's like this place is cursed!|next|It's super tough... I'm gonna need the others' help!@...What a tragedy, to see a fellow Beetle befall this fate.|next|Its carapace is absurdly tough. Leif, support me as I strike it!@Mngh... Why is this so familiar? We're feeling dizzy...|next|We can't faint now! We...we must support Kabbu in piercing its defense...!
The Watcher@Of unknown origin, this Roach-shaped creature only knows its purpose is to guard the artifact.|line||halfline|Capable of speech and intelligent thought, it is all the more baffling to know it has never been alive.@Why can't we ever just grab the artifact? There's always gotta be a creepy, giant, or creepy giant monster!|next|We're super close to the Sapling. I'm not gonna let you stop me!@What a formidable sorcerer! I can't predict its moves at all. Perhaps because |unpauseline|it is not truly alive...|next|Defeating it will be an act of mercy. And my horn shall deliver |unpauseline|victory!@...What sad magic. Trapped in here, feeling nothing but anger and contempt.|next|We'll put you to rest, forever this time!
Peacock Spider@Sailors speak of an island in the far reaches of Metal Lake.|line||halfline|An addicting beat drives them to explore its uncharted shores.|line||halfline|By then, it's already too late, as the Peacock Spider's song has drawn them to their doom...{Team Snakemouth finally confirmed this folk tale as reality, after their report on the beast's unique abilities.|line||halfline|It seems to have been able to summon reinforcements to empower with its dancing. |line||halfline|A tough battle, scholars imagine.@Cha-ka-cha-ka-cha-ka...|line|Bleh! Stop doing that! It's getting annoying!|next|And the shaking keeps making the others strong... We've gotta focus this guy down!@What mesmerizing sound... It drives me to shake my hips! Alas, we must not be distracted.|next|It has constant reinforcements that it powers up... Our priority should be this Spider!@Why is everyone dancing? ...We don't get it. Whatever.|next|It's clear this Spider is the boss. Let's cut the show short.
Bloatshroom@A toxic, massive shroom lying in the hidden parts of Snakemouth.|line||halfline|Although blind, it can navigate by feeling vibrations in the soil and air.|line||halfline|When it feels threatened, it shoots powerful poison gas.@Eep! How can such a big thing jump that high!? Watch out, everyone!|next|It's poisonous too... Good thing I've brought my Secret Stash! Leif, let's |line|pull out some ice moves!@Everyone, hold your breath! This humongous creature emits poison gas!|next|Leif, I know we ask too much of you...but focus your ice attacks |line|on it quickly!@This hideous thing... We feel it holds some connection to the Jellyshroom.|next|It should be equally weak to ice. Let's be wary of its poison and counterattack!
Krawler@An artificial entity created to defend the Lost Sand's castle.|line||halfline|Designed to adapt to any temperature, their weaponry applies different effects |line|based on the environment.|line||halfline|Attempts to engineer one from scratch in modern times have failed.@Is that a bug or a bot? It's mega weird. It even changes color when |unpauseline|it's cold!|next|I wonder if that makes it weaker to Kabbu's hits... I think my Beemerang's always gonna work, though!@What a fascinating creature. It reminds me of the factory's Menderbots! |unpauseline|It changes behavior depending on the temperature...|next|Its ice version is weak to my horn!|line|We must make sure to take note of which attacks are causing more damage!@That crystal... Could it be like those inside us? We should bring a piece to H.B.|next|The temperature affects it quite a bit. We'll toy around with it...see what works. Kabbu's horn is worth a shot in the cold.
Haunted Cloth@Running off the energy of ancient crystals, this being reacts to noise and|line|movement.|line||halfline|It seeks to incapacitate scavengers and absorb their energy as a backup energy reserve.@Get off! Get OFF me! Geez! This thing's got issues!|next|We can't let it get too close, so I'd best get smacking!@It worries me how used I am becoming to abominations such as these.|next|It is strong, but we are stronger. Let's do this!@This thing thirsts for energy. We can feel its desire for our magic.|next|But we're not eager to share. Time to bring it down.
Sand Wall@The best moment to stop datamining was when you opened the file@beetattle@beetletattle@mothtattle
Ice Wall@The next best moment was now@beetattle@beetletattle@mothtattle
Warden@These guardians were designed to hide in plain sight, attacking intruders while their guards lay low.|line||halfline|They adapt to the cold with ease, and won't stop chasing unwanted visitors until they leave or are buried beneath the sands.@Whoa whoa whoa! This is too much! A floating head!? With lasers!?|next|I'll bring it down and bury it where it belongs!@Oof! What a convincing disguise! We really must be on guard here...|next|My horn will be ready to strike when it is brought back into the ground!@Hmph. What a petty trick, hiding like that. But we could feel your magic since we stepped in.|next|Let's strike accordingly depending on the temperature, Kabbu.
Wasp King@No one cared who he was until he put on the crown...@beetattle@beetletattle@mothtattle
Jumping Spider@Playful and elusive, the Jumping Spider bounces around the grasslands while avoiding|line|its many predators.|line||halfline|Its hobbies include grabbing things, eating bugs, and jumping. Lots of jumping. Despite its mobility, it preys on stationary targets.@Oi! Stop jumping on me! Do you think I'm a springshroom!?|next|And give me my stuff back! It's expensive! Grr...I'll flip you over with |unpauseline|a |libraryline|Hurricane Toss!@How pitiful... So many legs, and yet you only jump!|next|Well, and steal. I must make sure our inventory remains safe!@Tch. We can't aim properly against this jumping nuisance. Kabbu, make sure to keep it away from our items.|next|Still, we're thankful this thieving pest |unpauseline|is nothing like Snakemouth's Spider...
Mimic Spider@These Spiders roam around the Forsaken Lands looking for innocent travelers to snack on. |line||halfline|Being able to stand upright, they can mimic the way other bugs like Ants move, even using their front legs as fake antennae.|line||halfline|Their sedating saliva can be a real pain in the neck.@Hiya-|anim,0,Flustered|AAAAAAHH!!!|fwait,0.5||anim,0,BattleIdle||line||wavy|Huff...Huff...|wavy||next|Heck this. You're going DOWN! As if you could put us to sleep after that scare!@|anim,1,Idle|Greetings, fellow Ant.

I shall strike you down!@This beast's quite aggressive. Its attacks seem to have numbing properties, so...|next|...? Vi! Kabbu! Stop freaking out and assist us!
Leafbug Ninja@The most cunning of the Leafbugs, the ninja faction hides in plain sight while hunting prey.|line||halfline|Using methods modern science still cannot comprehend, they are able to clone themselves.{The clones have mass and can cause damage, yet disappear upon being hit.|line||halfline|There is a reward posted for any researcher who manages to replicate the|line|technique.@Eep! Oi, don't just come out of nowhere! And stop kicking me!|next|Kabbu said they can clone or whatever... |libraryline|Doesn't matter. I'll just |unpauseline|beat them all up!@I was hoping to avoid such a confrontation... |libraryline|Everyone! These Leafbugs |unpauseline|are extremely skilled!|next|Not only do they hold powerful strikes, they can even multiply! |unpauseline|We'll have to hit many of them at once!@Nice moves. Kinda wish we could double ourselves too.|next|We're kind of in a hurry, so it'd be best to freeze them all |unpauseline|simultaneously.
Leafbug Archer@The archer faction is the most territorial of the Leafbugs, firing a volley of arrows at any who approach them.|line||halfline|Sometimes they get too into their job, and accidentally fire upon their allies.|line||halfline|No one dares complain, lest they get shot again.@Bring it on! It's bow vs. Beemerang! A super long-range battle!|next|They hurt a lot but look wimpy... Maybe we should focus on |unpauseline|them first before they call for help!@Ngh, what powerful arrows! They make focusing on the enemy before me much more difficult.|next|Vi, Leif, I trust you to deal with them while I clear out the rest! |unpauseline|Watch out for reinforcements!@That bow's no joke, it's packing quite the sting. Maybe we can freeze its string.|next|They're definitely annoying enough that it's worth focusing them down. Let's get on it, Vi, before they call for backup.
Leafbug Clubber@Possessing enough strength to topple branches, the clubber faction forms the frontline|line|of the Leafbugs.|line||halfline|They are cocky and proud, constantly demanding payment for every little thing|line|they do.|line||halfline|Even when denied, they're all too happy to fight and show off.@Grrr... Don't go thinking you're strong just cuz you can lift a big stick! |unpauseline|It's all about technique!|next|Time to show 'em what real skills look like!@Hmph. The cocky energy I feel from this enemy is appalling.|next|I'll make sure to tank their hubris and give my team the chance to strike!@What are they doing with that club? Did they just taunt us?|next|...|next|We'll see if they don't regret it after we're done with them.
Madesphy@With a face only a mother could love, the Madesphy grumpily trudges along the swamplands.|line||halfline|It's poisonous to eat, thorny to touch, and deafening to hear its wails.|line||halfline|One could say it has adapted to its habitat perfectly.@E-Eep! Kabbu, flip it over! It's so creepy! I get numb just hearing it!|next|As if the swamp wasn't spooky enough... |wavy|Huff!|wavy| Okay... I'm fine now. |unpauseline|Let's go!@What a pitiful creature, born to bear the face of evil and treat others so |unpauseline|poorly...|next|I shall lower its guard, so that we may dispatch it swiftly before its wails |unpauseline|can stun us!@This is...the most hideous critter we've ever encountered. Its dreadful |unpauseline|voice shocks us to the core...|next|We hope its high defenses protect its self-esteem as well. Kabbu, flip it over. |libraryline|We've got a special icicle waiting for it.
The Beast@This terrifying creature haunted the Wild Swamplands, devouring everything without |line|mercy.|line||halfline|The Leafbug tribes are the only inhabitants who adapted well enough |line|to evade it.|line||halfline|Kabbu brought it to its end, avenging the friends he lost while traveling to Bugaria...@Kabbu, calm down! Or you're gonna get hurt! ...Or get us hurt!|next|What do I do? It's super strong... Guess I'll just have to |unpauseline|do what I do best. Beat it up!@|shaky|GRAAAAAAAAAH!|shaky| |fwait,0.6|Today, you will suffer the pain of every bug you've hurt!|next|Vi, Leif...forgive my selfishness... Just this once, this is something I must do!@Kabbu! We understand your pain...but keep it together! We cannot |unpauseline|attack this beast without a plan!|next|Although, truth be told...it's strong and resilient. An all out offensive may be our only chance!
Chomper Brute@This Chomper has grown large and strong due to being in great proximity to both its mother and very fertile areas.|line||halfline|It can spawn strong young Chompers, and its bite can pierce through rock.@Whoa! What do they FEED this thing!? We've gotta be careful!|next|Let's gang up on it before it makes too many Chompers!@An enlarged version of a Chomper... We must be near its nest, then. |unpauseline|It must be protecting its territory.|next|We're sorry, you poor creature... But we cannot let you stop us!@Chompers are cute. When they're small. This one's lost a lot of the charm.|next|We'd best freeze it up before it spawns too many reinforcements.
Mantidfly@Resembling Wasps more than Mantids, yet unrelated to both, these fast hunters surprise explorers with their intelligence.|line||halfline|Their appetite demands they hunt for food, pillaging anything they can.|line||halfline|To prevent being confused with them, Wasps have a unique salute while scouting the Far Grasslands.@T-The Wasps found us! ...Oh, what? What bug is this?|next|Well, whatever. It's just another enemy I've gotta smack to the ground!@On your guard, everyone! We are under attack by a Wasp Scout!|next|Vi, you must force it to land on the ground. I can defeat it then!@Did they really fall for this disguise? Those two...|next|That aside, this enemy's got quite the varied skillset. We'll have to watch out while we block.
General Ultimax@A master of machinations and delegation, he is responsible for leading the Wasp King's missions.|line||halfline|While physically inept and a coward, he still commands the respect of his troops. Most likely due to fear of the Wasp King.|line||halfline|Also, his actual name is Fuff.@Grr! We don't have time for this! We've gotta get to the Wasp King!|next|For a general, this guy's really weak... I'll beat up everyone else first!@So you're the one who led the charge on the Ant Kingdom... I cannot |unpauseline|forgive you!|next|He seems to rely heavily on his troops. Let's clear them out first and |unpauseline|deliver justice!@Don't think you'll get away with bringing harm to those in our city. |unpauseline|Big mistake.|next|We'll beat you up nice and slow, after we deal with your pathetic lackeys.
Wild Chomper@These Chompers have grown immobile so they can absorb the rich nutrients of the Far Grasslands.|line||halfline|They've developed the ability to shoot seeds over great distances and extend their roots to strike and snare their prey.{Otherwise, they lay with their mouths open in hopes some careless bug will fall into them.|line||halfline|They are also capable of producing smaller Chompers like their Golden Hills counterparts, which will soon set root and|line|become new Wild Chompers.@Mmm... I don't have much to say. It's just an angry plant, really. Weak to ice and stuff. Nothing new.|next|It does heal up, so we've gotta focus it down or it'll just get back up!@If only this creature would stop shooting seeds at us, we could walk past |unpauseline|without a fight!|next|Maybe if Leif manages to freeze it, we could just avoid it...?@Ain't this the living version of a Security Turret... Fortunately, this |unpauseline|one's weak to ice.|next|As long as we block its vines and seeds, it shouldn't be a challenge.
Cross@Cross is a skilled but naive border guard, who always checks with his partner Poi for a second opinion.|line||halfline|He uses a crossbow to complement his naturally close-range attacks.@Whoa, that's a nice crossbow! Maybe I should try new weapons sometime...|next|Tough bite, too. We can't give him a chance to use all his attacks!@I'm sorry, Cross. We never meant to drag you into this...|next|Everyone, watch out for his crossbow. We must give them a worthy |unpauseline|battle!@This one's got buff arms and fancy weapons. Deadly combo.|next|Termites handle the cold well. Guess it's up to us if we want to |unpauseline|gamble on it.
Poi@Poi is a disciplined border guard who follows the law to the letter. He makes sure to keep his partner Cross on track.|line||halfline|He uses a sword to complement his naturally long-range attacks.@This guy's bonkers... He's got a cannon on his head!|next|We just have to show them we're a much stronger team!@Our apologies, Poi. We know you're just doing your job.|next|Everyone, watch out for his sword and cannon! We must fight with honor!@Tough luck, getting sent to fight us as part of the job.|next|The head cannon and sword are a nasty combo... We can't let our guard |unpauseline|down.|next|Termites handle the cold well. Guess it's up to us if we want to |unpauseline|gamble on it.
Primal Weevil@The most aggressive, unruly, and powerful type of Weevil, this primal creature stands at the top of the Forsaken Land's food chain.|line||halfline|Anyone traveling the area is well advised to carry little food, lest they risk catching its attention.@W-Whoa! That's nothing like the Golden Settlement's Weevils! It's HUGE!|next|Gotta watch out for the feints, and knock it down before it calls for help!@This must be the area's apex predator... What an incredibly fearsome |line|monster!|next|We must keep an eye on when to block, and stop it from calling |unpauseline|reinforcements!@Tch. It's vicious. Hard to cast magic while keeping up with blocking.|next|It seems to have lackeys nearby, too... Let's freeze them up and deal with them |libraryline|later.
False Monarch@Comprised entirely of the most intelligent Mothflies banding together, this creepy being stands as ruler of a land everyone's already deserted.|line||halfline|When defeated, the Mothflies disbanded, leaving the city truly abandoned once more.{Regrettably, there was not enough time to conduct an investigation on the Mothflies' speech patterns and social hierarchy.@Y-You can't scare me! You're just a bunch of Mothflies under a coat!|next|It's charging up! Leif, we've gotta block it!@Your collective's days of luring weary travelers to this town end |line|right now!|next|Stay sharp, Leif. We may need your defensive skills!@It seems these critters are under a royal delusion. Enough to grow quite powerful.|next|We must save some TP if we're to endure its strongest moves.
Mothfly@This adorable blob flies through the Forsaken Lands, searching for food.|line||halfline|It's weak, but surprisingly intelligent.|line||halfline|They say that when enough of them are nearby, something incredible could happen.@Hey... Isn't this a bit too weak to be hanging around here?|next|I kinda feel bad for it...but I'll smack it down anyways!@What a harmless creature! It's impressive that it has survived in such a dangerous area.|next|We can't afford to underestimate it, however. Vi! Lower it so that I |unpauseline|may strike!@Aww... A cute little blob, alone in such a place?|next|If we had more time, we'd consider domesticating it, but... Vi, you know |unpauseline|what to do.
Mothfly Cluster@The smartest of all Mothflies, after realizing they had better chances working as a team, conglomerated into this...thing.|line||halfline|Sturdier and stronger, enough hits should cause them to go their separate ways.|line||halfline|Sometimes, they do stick together even in defeat.@W-What the heck!? I shouldn't have called them so weak...|next|But it's STILL just a bunch of weak Flies together, right? Just gotta keep attacking!@Appearances are truly deceiving. I never expected them to possess such strong bonds!|next|Vi, lower them. If we scatter them, the battle is won!@One, cute. Twenty...not cute. This got out of hand really fast.|next|We should be able to freeze them all at once, anyhow.
Ironnail@Only the toughest, fastest, and strongest of snails could manage to survive in the Forsaken Lands.|line||halfline|Enter the Ironnail, capable of firing sedating beams and moving at high speeds.|line||halfline|They've developed a hatred of non-foggy areas, sparing other parts of Bugaria from their wrath.@O-Oi! Aren't snails slow and stuff? The Forsaken Lands really are super dangerous...|next|We can still just fight them like they're Numbnails, though. Right, Kabbu?@What speed...! We cannot underestimate any creature that |line|can survive in such a land.|next|Beware its sedatives. I shall drag it out of its shell when it retreats!@Tch. We got caught off guard by its movements. It mustn't happen again.|line|We almost got put to sleep...!|next|Kabbu, drag it out of its shell. Then, we shall freeze it in its tracks!
Belostoss@This extra large bug boasts impressive size and strength due to a mix of ruthless evolution and a really good diet.|line||halfline|It's aggressive and territorial, grabbing anything near it and lobbing it towards others.|line||halfline|Towns are wary whenever one is spotted outside of their usual caves, as the collateral damage they can cause is humongous.@...Y'all wouldn't consider just running from this one, right?|next|I know it's no Spider, but...-?! Whoa! It's got a giant rock! Kabbu, |unpauseline|hurry up and hit it!@Holy Smoked Shrooms...! It can carry such weight with ease!|next|Yet, I can feel its balance is shaky... I will try to knock the |line|rock out of its hands!@Whoa! That rock nearly splatted us... Haven't you heard of saying "hello"?|next|No response. Guess there's no point trying to negotiate, then... Time to |unpauseline|freeze it.
Ruffian@These freed prisoners are so dangerous, the Wasps left the cuffs on.|line||halfline|They don't care, though. They're cruel and cunning enough to wreak enough havoc using only their legs.|line||halfline|It will be a headache to round them up again...@Uh oh... I've seen this guy in a wanted poster! He's super dangerous!|next|He's flailing that chain like it's a leaf! Watch out for those kicks!@Hmph. So the Wasps have become so desperate as to employ even criminals...|next|His character may be poor, but his strength is considerable! Stay sharp!@My, what impressive legs. To be able to move so freely under that much weight...|next|Still, he's just a crook at the end of the day. We'll throw him back into his cell!
Water Strider@Despite their size, Water Striders are extremely light to the point that they can stand on water.|line||halfline|Their thin legs can skate through water or stretch to give them an intimidating height.|line||halfline|When everything else fails, they can shoot powerful pressurized water.@Whoa...! It's gliding on water! How's it not sinking!?|next|I can think about it later. I've gotta stop it from shooting so many water missiles!@Unbelievable! This creature must be extremely light to not sink |unpauseline|under the water!|next|Yet, its attacks are quite pressurized... We must not |unpauseline|drag this battle out!|next|Vi, keep it low to the ground!@Floating on water? Is this some sort of magic we could learn, as well...?|next|Its water projectiles are quite strong, but our Icefall should be a nice counterattack.|next|Vi, get it in range.
Diving Spider@This underwater bug can take in oxygen using a special bubble. Even so,|line|it surfaces from time to time.|line||halfline|It can deploy poisonous or high-pressure bubbles to protect itself |line|while scouting.|line||halfline|Although attempts have been made to pop its bubble, it doesn't seem to be possible.@An air bubble? Bleh. Why would anyone wanna live underwater!?|next|Ugh, and that shield's bouncing everything off! I hate having to wait!@I've never seen anything quite like this! A bug that can breathe underwater!|next|My...my horn can't pierce its water shield!? We'll have to await our chance...@What a curious evolution. Hmm. Perhaps we could use the Bubble |line|Shield to dive as well?|next|It uses its bubble to avoid attacks for a turn as well. Let's prepare to strike back.
Cenn@Born in the Golden Settlement, Cenn always found his peaceful town to be a big bore. |line||halfline|After moons of pranking the villagers, he moved to the Ant Kingdom and met Pisci.{His dreams of forming a rascal team were shut down by Maki, and he resorted to petty vandalism.|line||halfline|Hopefully some time behind bars will help him rehabilitate...@What, you get called out and you come at us with a stick!?|next|Like that'd work on something like a Spider... Just give up already!@Maki's judgment was correct. You're not ready to be an explorer!|next|It's not only to gain riches, but to help others! Now, let's count up your |unpauseline|sins!@What a clumsy weapon. It's clear this one hasn't fought any real battles.|next|That doesn't mean he's not stubborn, though. We'll have to |unpauseline|put him in his place.
Pisci@Pisci always felt out of place in the orderly Ant Kingdom. After meeting Cenn, she truly blossomed into a troublemaker.|line||halfline|Her new lifestyle was cut short when Maki rejected their team, and Team Snakemouth caught them harassing Amber.|line||halfline|Maybe after her sentence is up, she'll go back to a quiet life.@Oi, you can't solve your problems throwing rocks at us!|next|...I didn't say that so you'd build a wall! ...Whatever, the Beemerang goes around it...@You're making this more difficult than it needs to be. The first step to being forgiven is apologizing!|next|O-Oof, that rock got me in the horn... That's it! I'm crushing you and your rocks!@Your inexperience shines through. You're really dealing with this whole |unpauseline|thing the wrong way.|next|Doesn't seem like you're willing to listen... Our ice will sneak past |line|your defenses.
Dead Lander α@One of the incomprehensible beasts that lay beyond Bugaria's safe haven.|line||halfline|It is too risky to engage, even with a full exploration team. Flee on sight.|line||halfline|More information would be too risky to gather.@What the heck is that? Is that even a bug!? Dead Landers creep me out...|next|It's got all sorta poisons, and it can dig! Leif, be ready to bring it out!@Ngh, the real monsters don't compare to the northern tales. What firepower...|next|Focus on blocking its poison, team. Leif, unearth it when it burrows!@What a terrifying organism... We can't get a read on it at all. And it's got quite potent poisons, too.|next|When we pressure it, it burrows to hide. It won't expect our ice magic underground!
Dead Lander β@One of the incomprehensible beasts that lay beyond Bugaria's safe haven.|line||halfline|It is too risky to engage, even with a full exploration team. Flee on sight.|line||halfline|More information would be too risky to gather.@Yeugh! What is this slimy stuff it's spitting!? GROSS!|next|No matter how much I hit it, it's not coming down...guess it's up to me!@This disgusting, poison vomiting creature is simply out of my reach...|next|Vi, Leif, I have never needed you more than I do now!@Ugh. Just ugh. This disgusting liquid...! How dare you drench us in it!?|next|It cannot be knocked down from the air... We'll have to use our TP wisely.
Dead Lander γ@One of the incomprehensible beasts that lay beyond Bugaria's safe haven.|line||halfline|It is too risky to engage, even with a full exploration team. Flee on sight.|line||halfline|More information would be too risky to gather.@I dunno what's scarier, this or the thing that dropped it... M-Maybe we should flee?|next|That claw's super scary, but the spores are trouble too! We gotta be |unpauseline|careful!@What cursed creature could carry these monsters with ease!? We may even need to consider retreating...!|next|We must block those spore missiles, but that claw cannot be ignored, either!@By Elizant... Does the thing that dropped this creature see our struggle as |unpauseline|a game!? Running may be a good idea...|next|Tch. This thing's got powerful melee and ranged attacks. We'll have to give it our all.
Wasp King@Hoaxe was abandoned by his parents in the middle of the Dead Lands, before he spoke his first words. |line||halfline|Only through a miracle did he survive to reach Bugaria, where he managed to blend into the Wasp Kingdom's populace.|line||halfline|He had no friends, and no respect. All he had was his job: cleaning up trash.{One day, he vanished from the Wasp Kingdom. Nobody cared.|line||halfline|When he returned, unrecognized by all who ostracized him, he commanded such power and charisma...|line||halfline|They had no choice but to serve him.@You're gonna pay for that invasion! Your plans are super over!|next|The fire still hurts a bit, but we can take it now! Time to show him what Team Snakemouth's made of!@Vile usurper, who has led the Wasp Kingdom to ruin... Today, bugkind will be freed from your villainy.|next|We must not waste this opportunity the Flame Brooch has given us! Give it your all, everyone!@Sweet payback. We've been waiting for a good few missions to bring karma upon you.|next|Everyone, even though the Flame Brooch protects us, don't get careless. |line|We can't afford to lose!
The Everlasting King@Although the Everlasting Sapling seemed wilted, it still possessed enough power to morph Hoaxe into an incredibly powerful form.|line||halfline|Commanding the power of the artifacts, the flames, and the Sapling, there was no logical way for Team Snakemouth to win.{What was the reason, then, for Hoaxe's power to eventually run out...?|line||halfline|Sadly, as the Everlasting Sapling is no more, research cannot be conducted.@You dumb jerk! You've caused my friends too much trouble! We're gonna save everyone!|next|I'll get the flying artifacts down... I trust you guys with your parts!@Everyone...we have never faced power like this. It's overwhelming, but we stand together!|next|Let us destroy the artifacts as he summons them. We must press on |unpauseline|until the end!@This is it, huh. Vi, Kabbu...thanks for all the good times.|next|We can feel the artifacts... Let's destroy them as soon as they appear. |unpauseline|We can't stop now!
Maki@The Queen's Blade, Maki, is both Elizant II's most trusted knight and the leader of the highest-ranked exploration team.|line||halfline|He is the only one with the authority to certify new explorers, such as Team |line|Snakemouth.{Although he tends to operate alone, he has grown to respect Team Snakemouth after their journey to the Wasp Kingdom.|line||halfline|His new favorite food is the MiteBurger.@Alright! It's time to show you how much we've grown since the test!|next|Guys, when we hit Maki...Kina gets like, super mad. Who should we target first...?@Sir Maki...thank you for everything you've done for us. Even this sparring match. We will rise to your challenge!|next|Kina reacts poorly to her brother being hurt, and Yin keeps supporting him... Tough decisions await us!@We do respect you, but we weren't around to witness the birth of this rivalry. Still, we won't turn down an excuse to flex our magic.|next|Both Kina and Yin support Maki in their own ways. We must choose our target carefully.
Kina@Extremely protective of her brother Maki, Kina forms the second half of Bugaria's best exploration team.|line||halfline|She is extremely capable and holds great strength. She is quite selfish, however. One |line|would be hard-pressed to find her helping others without Maki or the Queen's |line|orders.{She used to hold a great dislike for Yin, who she considered to be stealing Maki's attention.|line||halfline|Her favorite drink is the Aphid Shake.@W-Whoa, I thought Kina was just getting carried by Maki all this time! |unpauseline|She's super fast!|next|It's gonna take some practice, but if we're gonna take this beating then we've gotta Super Block!@The bonds between Maki and Kina are true indeed. They fight perfectly coordinated!|next|There's too much pressure... We must Super Block if we are to |line|endure this battle!@Yikes. Why was Maki even worried about you? Your skills are something else...|next|It'll take time to knock out one of them. We'll have to make our best effort to Super Block until then.
Yin@An unusual caterpillar who wasn't able to pupate.|line||halfline|With Maki, Kina, and Team Snakemouth's help, she reached her true form.|line||halfline|The sole known user of healing magic, the good she could bring to Bugaria is endless.{Regardless, she's still a bit childish. It will be up to Maki to raise her into an upstanding citizen.|line||halfline|Her favorite food is the Sweet Shroom.@How's she so strong!? She's like, just barely an adult! N-Not stronger than me, though.|next|She's got a lot of annoying magic and items! Sorry Maki, but she's gonna go down!@So this is the true power of Maki's team! ...No, with Yin's magic, they've grown even stronger!|next|Yin's supportive abilities make her a priority. Even if her defeat may upset Maki greatly!@Poor thing. Barely out of the cocoon, and already fighting the |unpauseline|best of the best.|next|...We say that, but she's no pushover. Even if Maki gets |unpauseline|mad, we must defeat her too.
ULTIMAX Tank@Fuff's ultimate form, harnessing the power of the Wasp Kingdom's most dangerous arsenal.|line||halfline|The machine was built for the Wasp royalty to use in case of emergency, but Fuff stole it after the Wasp King took over.|line||halfline|This baby's got so much firepower.@That's NOT FAIR! You can't just...you can't just hop on |line|whatever that is!|next|What's the Beemerang gonna do against that...? G-Guys, help me out!@We will not be intimidated by your advanced weaponry! You cannot stop us!|next|My horn can still pierce through... For Bugaria, I'll take |line|this thing down!@...Alright, then. We've definitely never seen anything like this before.|next|Even so, you're just another hurdle in our path! Kabbu's horn should be able to pierce through!
Zommoth@All of the Roaches' research lead to this. The ultimate immortal guardian.|line||halfline|What they couldn't predict was being unable to control it, as it razed the laboratory |line|of life with its monstrous magic.|line||halfline|Is this what Leif could have been...?@...Leif...I dunno what's going on, but it's gonna be okay!|next|This thing's nothing like you! So let's defeat it together!@L-Leif! Do not lose yourself! We must work together to overcome |unpauseline|this beast!|next|Whatever memories have awoken...we too, shall face them |unpauseline|together after this battle!@|anim,2,WeakBattleIdle|......|fwait,1.0||anim,2,BattleIdle|I...we...can't afford to hesitate.|next|We'll deal with these feelings...after you've been disposed of!
Riz@This crafty Damselfly has managed to make a living in the Far Grasslands.|line||halfline|He uses a robust system of traps and tracking to stay safe while sleeping and |line|collecting food.|line||halfline|Thankfully, he seems to be fluent in Bugnish.@Oi! For once, we don't wanna fight! Just stop hitting us! Grr...|next|Those bombs can rack up damage fast. We'll have to plan around them!@Please, you must reconsider! ...Why does everything in Bugaria get solved with violence!?|next|Don't underestimate him, team. Surviving in these lands is no easy task!@For someone with the smarts to craft those bombs, aren't you being unreasonable?|next|...He got mad. Maybe we spoke a bit too much this time...
Devourer@In the early days of the Golden Settlement, windmills were being set absolutely everywhere to test energy production limits.|line||halfline|A team of scientists began building a few east of the town, not noticing the flytraps growing underneath them...{By the time they realized it, it was too late. A gigantic Devourer attacked, accompanied by vicious flytraps.|line||halfline|Although most managed to escape, the Devourer had yet to pay for those it swallowed whole.|line||halfline|In an expedition, Team Snakemouth finally delivered justice.@Eep! That thing's huge! And poisonous! ...And HUNGRY! |unpauseline|And it's got friends!|next|This sucks! We've gotta beat it before we all get eaten!@Ngh...You monster...how dare you devour other bugs!? I'll cut you and your lackeys' stems down!|next|Vi, Leif...if someone gets swallowed, fight from within! We shall not flee until you escape!@To think a plant and its minions could harbor such malice... This fight doesn't favor us.|next|It may aim to swallow us. Vi, Kabbu, don't even think about fleeing |unpauseline|before we break free.

Stratos@Team Slacker's brawn. His giant stature betrays his kind disposition.|line||halfline|His weapon isn't actually special - his proficiency with the blade makes the wood|line|cut like steel.|line||halfline|His favorite food is Plumpling Pie.@Heheh. Leave it to me, guys! I'll buzz around hi-WOAH!|next|H-He's so fast, what the heck!? That's not fair when he's so bulky! @Do not be fooled by his calm disposition, my friends. I can sense in |unpauseline|Stratos the heart of a warrior!|next|If we can't decipher his swordplay soon, we won't be able to block |unpauseline|effectively!@...We underestimated them. What a shame that they didn't use this power to help us stop the Wasp King.|next|Stratos can fire shockwaves from sheer strength...it's not even magic. What a guy.
Delilah@Team Slacker's wit. She's turned selling information into a profitable venture.|line||halfline|She's gathered many poisons while exploring, which she can use to incapacitate|line|more powerful enemies.|line||halfline|Her favorite drink is Doppel's Berry Juice.@A bazooka!? Did you get that from Shades!? It's full of bombs!|next|Woah, that's a sticky bomb! We can't use items if that hits, they cost a fortune!@Miss Delilah is suddenly so menacing...! And that's without her |unpauseline|impressive weapon. It can seal away our items!|next|Those bombs carry most cumbersome effects. We must make sure |unpauseline|to stay healthy!@Items, bombs and speed... Delilah is more resourceful than we anticipated.|next|Losing access to our items would be awful. We should probably incapacitate her first.
