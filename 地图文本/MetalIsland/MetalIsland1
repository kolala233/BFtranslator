It's Stratos and Delilah.|next,-4|Wonder what they are doing here...
Looks like you can't carry it... But please remember to come back to try out some of my tea!

Hmph. You look like you have light pockets.|next|You won't get much enjoyment here unless you have many berries to spare.
Wasps are attacking? It doesn't really concern me. We pay the |line|guards well here.
Now that the Wasp Kingdom is cool with the Ant Kingdom, we are getting more tourists.|next|Great, the more money comes in, the better!
My mom said that I could spend these Dark Cherries on whatever I want!|line|I wonder what I should try next...

Welcome to Metal Island. The safest, fanciest area in all of Bugaria!

Rails haven't been built yet, so please be careful while walking |line|on the pier!
|tail,-6|Hmm. Does a place like this truly need guards?|next|Feels like the price of the ferry weeds out troublemakers already.|next,-5|They're insurance. If a rich evildoer came along, who would |line|protect Metal Island!?|next,-4,Happy|...Us! We'd get rich!|anim,-5,WeakBattleIdle|
Bleh. This island is a symbol of empty consumerism...But it has good food.
|tail,-6|Hmph. If you're going to complain, you should stay firm and |line|skip the food.|next,-5|...Well, have you TASTED Master Slice's food!? It's...it's exquisite!|next,-4|I thought you were the one with like, dignity and stuff, Kabbu.|next,-5|E-Err... I-It's just food...
|tail,-6|The smell's nice. We don't come across tea this high quality often.|next,-5|Ah...it's true. A nice, relaxing brew would do wonders for my wings!|next,-4|I want a super spicy one! To get me all pumped up!
|tail,-4|Woah! Samira's here!? Did she get a discount!?|next,-5|She must be doing incredibly well!|next,-6|These are really high profile clients. It's thanks to you, Vi.|next,-4,Happy|Nah. It's all 'cuz she worked hard!
Heheh. It's nice to meet other first time visitors!|next,-6|Yeah. Everyone else seems used to the glamour.|next,-4|I don't think I'll ever get tired of eating fancy stuff! ...You think she will?

"Spuder"? Did he mean...the Spider boss card!?|next,-6|No way, that card's got the wrong colors. It's a fake.|next,-4|People care enough to make fakes of these...?
|tail,-6|He's here, too? Now we know he's a true gourmet.|next,-4|What, just 'cuz he spends money to eat?|next,-6|Many people boast being refined, but wouldn't make the sacrifice to travel here.|next,-5|Truth be told, I do believe I enjoy eating...|next|But if our travels hadn't brought us here, I wouldn't have tried to eat Master Slice's food!|next,-4|You two think about this way too hard...

Metal Island's nice, but...I wish we could get a house in the Wasp Kingdom...
Mmm...I'm glad sis is doing fine.|next|I gotta start thinking of moving, though. Can't be a third wing forever!
