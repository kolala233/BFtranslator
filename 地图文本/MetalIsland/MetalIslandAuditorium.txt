|tail,-6|This is it. The Card Master tournament.|next,-4|Bring out your strongest cards!|next,-5|You've got our support, Leif!
Ugh. What a disgrace. Even with all the money that flows here, they still haven't fixed this hole in the wall.|next|I can't stand this, it feels like anything can just crawl out of there!|next|Maybe I should take my business elsewhere.
...Begone.|next|Unless you are a champion, you and I have zero business between us.
Ah, you there, green lad. You are a northerner as well, aren't you?|next|I haven't been back to the homeland in decades. I wonder if life is better there nowadays.|next,-5|...
Oh, new meat? Great. The current competition was starting to get stale.|next|Here we hold down the |color,1|Spy Cards Championship|color,0|.|next|You probably already know that since you managed to defeat the Card Masters.|next|Let's cut to the chase. If you win the tournament, you can get many, many berries.|next|You will have to fight 3 battles in a row with the same deck. No changing in between.|next|Only one of you can participate, however. So decide who it will be.|next,-5|Hm. Who should play then?|next,-4|...Uh, Leif. Duh!|next,-6|Mhm. We are ready to start whenever.|next,caller|If you are ready, just say the word. Don't leave our sponsors waiting.|flag,646,true|

Then don't waste my time!
Oh, new players?|next|Don't get in my way then. I will win, you hear! That reward is |shaky|MINE!
Woah, woah! Everyone here is so serious! Can't we all just calm down|line|and relax? It's just a game!
Howdy folks! New to the game? Me too!|next|My grandpa used to be the best Spy Cards player there was! He never lost a single battle!|next|Before he retired, he gave me his deck, something he has been building for years! And with this...|next|Watch me, gramps! I will win using this special deck!
Heh. No one's going to expect |shaky|THAT|shaky| card in my deck!
...Listen. This is already the cheapest fee I can do. Either |line|pay up or get lost.
Welcome once more, to the Spy Cards Championship! Today, eight competitors will fight and try to reach|line|the top!|next|Here are today's competitors...

You will feel true despair...when you face my cards!

...Tch...Do I not have enough hatred...!?
|tail,-6|This Ladybug has suffered so much... We can feel it.|next|We must not let our guard down. That pain's carried over to his deck.|next,-4|It's just cards!
|tail,-6|It seems we're not the only ones with a lot of support.|next,-5|Everyone here fought hard for their spot. It won't be easy!|next,-4|You've got this, though! No problem!|next,-6|...It seems our support may just be the best in the hall. 
|tail,-6|We hope to match with her in the tournament. What a good aura.|next,-4|Is it really ok to be so relaxed?|next,-5|Some battle for glory... She seems to only want a good match!
|tail,-6|We admire creativity, but...there is a beauty in playing optimally.|next,-4|If you're trying to win, you can't waste time showing off!|next,-5|This coming from you, Vi?|next,-4,Angry|Oi! I always try my super best!
|tail,-6|What a poisonous aura...toxic, even.|next,-5|I do get a feeling of condescension...|next,-4,BattleIdle|It's gonna make winning much sweeter!
|tail,-5||anim,-5,WeakBattleIdle|Someone traveled all the way from the north...to watch a card game...|next,-6|Kabbu? What's wrong?|next,-5,Idle|N-Nothing...|minibubble,@Huh...,-4||breakend|
|tail,-6|He's got class, we'll give him that.|next,-5|In a high-end establishment, even the staff must look the part.|next,-4|I bet the outfit cost more than the ride here...
|tail,-4|This guy's right to be mad! We pay way too much for the wall to be cracked!|next,-5|Ngh...For some reason I...want to see what's under it!|next,-6|Okay...?
|checktrue,647,67||tail,-6|How rude.|next,-4,Angry|Who does she think she is!?|next,-5|We'd do well to not pay her dismissiveness any mind...
|tail,-6|...Hmph.|next,-4|Now that you won she's all over you, huh.|next,-6|...Let's go.
