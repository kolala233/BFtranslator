I've never seen such a massive inn!|next,-6|Bugs travel across the sea just to stay here... Could it be that great?|next,-4|We won't know if we don't stay, right?
|boxstyle,3||spd,0|For Ant Kingdom Explorers Only!|line|Head to the end of the hallway for a quick tunnel to the Ant Palace!
|checkmapflag,0,7|...Welcome to the Metal Hotel.|next||showmoney|One room for three costs 40 berries for the night. It includes a hand-made dish by the one and only|line|Master Slice.|next|Are you interested in spending a night with us?|prompt,map,3,2,3,4,@We'd like to stay.,5|
|checkmoney,40,4||money,-40|...Thank you for choosing us. Your room is the first in the hallway. Have a good night.|break||event,122|

No way, that's too much!
|boxstyle,4||spd,0|It's locked from the inside.
We hope you had a pleasant night. Please consider staying with us once more in the future.

I apologize for my previous behavior, masters.|next|You are welcome in the great hall of the Spy Card Champions! Please proceed.
You are welcome in the great hall of the Spy Card Champions! Please proceed.
...That girly doll is not proof!|next,-5,Hurt||boxstyle,0|G-girly?!|next,-4|Woah! Brutal!|next,caller|Don't waste my time! Bring me proof or you shall not pass!
Man, digging here was a lot of work! The tunnel goes all the way under the lake!|next|We had to patch for leaks pretty frequently... I hope we never have to do |line|that again!
I don't know why the Queen wants to make a tunnel here... This is a privately owned Island.|next|I heard she paid over a million berries to get the tunnel done here... |line|Kinda wish they'd gone to our city.
|wavy|Ohohoho!|wavy| I have come from very far away to see the card tournaments held here!|next|They say you need to prove yourself by defeating the four |line|masters to enter...|next|But even before challenging them, you need an invite card from someone who's already defeated them.|next|It's so alluring! So exclusive!|line||wavy|Ohohoho!|wavy|
What the-
What are you doing here?! This is my room!|next||shaky|Aaaah! You destroyed the wall! You think I won't mind because |line|I'm rich!?|shaky||next|How dare you! I thought you were decent bugs!|next,-5,WeakBattleIdle|W-We're sorry! I saw a gap, and I just felt the urge to dig!|next,-4,Angry|Yeah. You've really gotta complain to management.|next,caller|And you're blaming ME for the hotel's faults!?|next,-6|Err, no...just...|next,caller||shaky|I'VE LOST MY TEMPER! WE'RE DUELING!
Ugh. You could've let me win, you know...|next,-6|We ARE sorry, but no.|next,caller|...|wavy|*Sigh*|wavy|. I'll go tell management about the gap...|next,-5|We're...we're truly sorry!|next,caller|Whatever. Get out. I've got to prepare for the tournament.
You seriously think I want to talk?|next||wavy|*Sigh*|wavy| ...Why did I teach you how to play...
|tail,-6|Carmina's a pretty formidable duelist.|next,-4|And she can fight well, too!|next,-5|Team, perhaps we should discuss Carmina...outside of her room?
I heard one top card player is somewhere around Bugaria looking for challengers.|next|Whoever it is, It is the only way to get an invitation to the card challenge, unless you have thousands of berries.
Please watch yourselves. I pride myself on keeping these halls clean.
I've lived in luxury since birth. It's all so mundane... And others work their whole lives to be rich?|next|If only they knew it's nothing special... So depressing...
|tail,-4||anim,-4,Angry|...Bugs that look down on others...|anim,-4,Flustered|Are the |shaky|worst|shaky|!|next,-5||anim,-4,Angry|Vi, what's gotten into you?|next,-4|I can tell he only treats others nice if they've got berries! It's disgusting!|next,-6|Since getting here is so expensive, he probably just thinks we're being cheap...
Is that...custom made armor? To guard a card game?|next,-6|Are you implying Spy Cards does not deserve such a thing?|next,-5|Ah, um...|next,-4|Of course it doesn't! It's just a children's card game!|next,-6|Tch. You're so clueless...
|tail,-4|...|next,-6|What's up? Fancy a bowtie too?|next,-4|I just think it's weird. Leaving the Hive just to work for someone else...|next,-5|She seems quite proud and content. Perhaps it was her dream?|next,-4|Maybe...I don't get it, though...
|tail,-6|All this Ant Kingdom personnel disrupt things a bit, don't you think?|next,-4|Yeah. They still gotta pretty up stuff around the tunnel.|next,-5|It's a small sacrifice. Surely the guests will understand!
|tail,-4|Complaining that she has everything... There's no way |line|I'm gonna feel sorry for her.|next,-6|Her problems are...not relatable, yeah.|next,-5|We will probably never understand how she feels, but...|next||anim,-5,WeakBattleIdle|Does that truly mean we can't try to empathize...?
|tail,-6|What's that in her hand?|next,-5|Oh, that's a fan! They've become quite trendy lately.|next|You wave them quickly to blow refreshing air into your face!|next,-6|Interesting invention...|next,-4|It's not hot in here though. She's probably just showing off...
I wish Ms. Amber could enjoy the resort...|next,-4|She's probably getting paid a billion berries to come here, it's fine!|next,-6|You're sure it's not a billion berries to GET here...?
