|tail,-6|Ain't this place fancy.|next,-4|A bit too fancy. It's straight out of the Bee Kingdom. Yuck.|next,-5|You know, Vi... for someone who cares so much for treasure, you dislike most high-class establishments.|next,-4|It's just too pretentious! Use money to eat good food, or go on a trip!|next|I hate when bugs use money just to look important!|next,-6|Ah, Vi. You're not too bad after all.|next,-4|What's that "after all" supposed to mean?|next,-5|Just take the compliment, Vi. Just take it.
Fuzzo's part of the traveling caravan that comes through|line|Bugaria.|next,-4|What's he doing here anyway?|next,-6|This place will fill up with fancy folk. Maybe he is selling expensive items.|next,-5|We should speak to him, perhaps he has something of use.
|tail,-4|Hehe. Chubee's always traveling and looking for good stuff, huh.|next,-6|And she's one impressive eater.|next,-5|It makes me happy to see you have other friends, Vi! 
|tail,-4|Woah, Chubee's an actress!?|next,-5|It seems she holds many talents, aside from eating!|next,-6|If she's as good at acting as she's eating, this should be good.

Audience's getting impatient. Don't take too long!
Once upon a time, there laid a kingdom in a desert with an immense |line|oasis.|next|Travelers from all over the world wished to visit. For its clear water |line|and its beautiful ruler.|next|The princess would greet all who came with smiles and hospitality.|next|It was so, how an evil prince fell in love... 
I cannot leave my people. They are my pride, my joy!|next||gettail,138|Oh, how I wished for thee to make this easy.|next|You have left me no choice!
No... Stop, stop!
No... The kingdom...! How dare you! I will never love you!|next||gettail,138|You say that now, Princess.|next|You will forget these lands when you witness all I rule over!
Halt, you fiend! You will sully the princess no longer!|next,-4|Yeah! Uh, give her back!|minibubble,30,-5||next,-5|W-We will stop you!
|wavy|(She forgot her lines...!)
|anim,this,Idle||shaky|Minions!|shaky| Get rid of these pests. We have places to be.
The crowd went up and left.
Alright, let's kick their butt!|minibubble,34,-5||next,-6|You freakish beasts, you dare stand between us and the princess!?|next|You chose poorly. Prepare yourself!
|wavy|Sigh... 
H-Help me! Somebody save me!
Curses! That villain escaped with the princess.|next,-5|Whatever shall we do now? How will we face the people!?|next,-4|We will get her back! After them!
The unlikely heroes left their loved homeland behind, with the princess|line|in their heart.|next|The journey was long, and the desert unforgiving... 
|shaky|Water... Oh gods, guide us to water...|shaky||next,-6|Do not complain! Our suffering is slim, compared to what the |line|princess faces.|next,-4|Ugh, I bet she's getting treated real nice.|minibubble,39,4||break||destroyminibubble||end|

Let me go already, you monster!|next||gettail,138||boxstyle,0|Even with all my riches, with the grandeur of my land...|next|You would still reject me!?
Stifling heat and frigid nights were no match for the knights' spirit. They reached the prince's lair with fire in their eyes.|next|And now, it was time to take back what they had lost... 
Oh, the evil prince. He is so scary and imposing!|next,-4|Hey! Give the princess back!|next,-6|You will pay for your crimes!|next,4|My knights! You've come to my aid!|next||gettail,138||boxstyle,0|Why... Why must fate work against me?
Very well. I shall end thee, and take all I want by force!
No...I can still fight!|next|I will show you my true power!|next,-6|No... We are too drained from the fight!|next,-5|Is this the end for us...?|next,-4,BattleIdle|Hey, I can still fight!
