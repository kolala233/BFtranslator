You can kinda see it from all the way up in the Hive...|next,-5|It must be exciting to see those far off lands!|next,-4|I mean, kinda...

Running the quest board's so boring. I miss staring at the |line|sea from our boat!
I've tailored my very own floatation device! Now I won't sink, |line|even if it rains!
With these gadgets, I can put my face underwater and look around.|line|Someday, I'll see the sea's hidden mysteries!
It's a shame, but they've run out of tea. Oh, the flavor a leaf and some water can bring forth... 
Bugs be thinking of the sea as some vacation nowadays. They best watch out, cuz it don't play around... 
|tail,-6|We meet again...|next,-4|He really is everywhere!|next,-6|Hope you won't mind if we stay for a snack.
That device looks quite fascinating! I won't lie, I feel the|line|need to try it on...|next,-6|It looks like it'd fit you just fine. Maybe you should ask.|next,-4|No way!

That poor sailor...|next,-6|What do you reckon happened to him?|next,-4|Dunno... It's just the sea.|next,-5|I feel like it'd be best if we didn't try to figure it out. It could be most unpleasant.
|checktrue,370,32||tail,-4,Angry|Grr...|next,-5|Err, Vi?|next,-4|How can they charge so many berries for a boat ride? It's insane!|next,-6|We thought you hated the water, Vi.|next,-4|You don't get tired on a boat. And it's way less tiring than flying to an island!|next,-5|The boat must be quite expensive to maintain...|next,-4,Flustered|I don't care! It's too many berries!|next,-5|Guess we'll have to save up, or wait for a better deal.
|tail,-6|This bug's fashion sense is impeccable.|next,-4|What about me?|next,-6|You're doing just fine.|next,-4,Angry|Oi, just say I look good!

Well, here we are. If you ever want to head back, you know where to find me.
|wavy|M-my boat...|next|The Wasps sunk it... 
We had just received reports that the Wasps were sinking ships. But by the time we arrived they'd left.|next|At least there were no casualties.
Darn...I was just about to test my new flotation device... but I am not going in the water with the Wasps around!
Well, I suppose the sea mysteries will have to be left to another time.|next|There are Wasps all around Metal Lake. They all headed towards Rubber Prison.|next|I hope Metal Island is fine.
These blasted Wasps... thinkin' they own the sea...|next|The sea never forgives.
I'd rather be out at sea than here, but now is one of the few times I actually want to stay here.

Hmph. Might as well take this opportunity to retire...
|tail,-6|Pier food's got a certain something.|next,-4|It's, uh, saltier?|next,-5|It must be something in the area's water, perhaps?|next,-6|As long as we don't get food poisoning, it's fine.
