Stratos! Delilah! How are you doing?|next,d|Ah! Team Snakemouth! We're doing fine. We were investigating the outskirts for secrets!|next,s|It seems there is a place Seedlings like to gather up ahead. But you need to cross the river to reach it.|next,d|Indeed. But we don't have time to try to cross it! More mysteries await to be unveiled!|next,-6|So you will just leave that area unchecked?|next,d|Think of it more as an opportunity for you to find out more about it!|next|By the way, I have heard that the "Seedling Haven" is a great spot to find |color,1|Golden Seedlings|color,0|.|next,s|Be careful though, Golden Seedlings are really strong and you|line|shouldn't underestimate them.|next|But they are known for carrying rare berries, so it is up to you to fight them or not.|next,-4|Well, I can't say no to treasure! Thanks for the tip!|next,d|No problem! Stay safe!|break||event,false||end|
Up ahead in the outskirts is the "Seedling Haven". It's just an area|line|Seedlings like to gather in.|next|Don't know why, though, but it seems it is easier to find Golden Seedlings there!
I sensed a strong presence just beyond the river.|next|Be careful when going there.
Oh, it's Stratos and Delilah.|next,-6|Seems they were busy exploring. Let's see if they have any info for us.

Your team is more reliable than I expected.|next|It's a pretty simple job, really. Take this package.|break||flag,480,true||giveitem,1,149,115|
|tail,-6,instant|What's in this?|next,caller|Don't open it, okay? Just deliver it!|next|My friend's a diver ant in the Bugaria Pier |color,1|east|color,0| from the Association. |line|To reach it, just keep walking!|next,-4,Happy|Do you wanna pay us now, or is your friend gonna?|minibubble,117,-5||next,caller|She'll be waiting with a little something. No worries.|minibubble,@Cool.,-4||next,-6|We'll get going then. Good luck with the paperwork.|breakend|
|checktrue,613,137||checktrue,671,142|Thanks for the help. Guess your team's just gonna get more and more known, huh?|next|If you need me to process some quest paperwork, just check out |line|the board!
Vi!
Ahead is the pier and the path to the Lost Sands, be careful when heading that way.
|tail,-4|Is this the soldier that was guarding the Snakemouth Gate?|next,-5|Hm... No, this seems to be someone else.|next,-6|How can you tell? Most soldiers look alike.|next,-5|It's the glimmer in her eye! The aura she radiates!|next,-4|...There's numbers on the armor.
Halt, you criminal dorks!|next,e1||face,e1,gen||face,e2,gen|How did you find us so fast!?|next,eri|It's cuz we're like, actual explorers!|next,e2,BattleIdle||anim,e1,BattleIdle|Let's beat them into silence, Cenn!|next,eri,Surprized|O-Oi, that's not necessary!|next,-5|Gen, Eri! Good job locating the frauds!|next,-6|We won't waste our breath negotiating.|next,-4|Yeah! Let's just beat 'em up!|next,e1|Darn, they're too strong. What do we do!?|next,-5|Just give it up! There's a reason Maki refused your application!|next,e2|What would he know? Y'all are just the Queen's lapbugs!|next|No one has the right to tell us we can't explore!|next,-4|...|next|I get how you feel. But...the answer wasn't to become criminals!|next|It was to train and become stronger, so you could do the dangerous stuff!|next,e1|Don't lecture us! We'll see who needs to get stronger after this!
Give it up! You're super outmatched!|next,e1||shaky|Tch. You preachy bunch...
|shaky|H-Heheh...|shaky| You didn't notice our plan.|next,e2|Our escape route's clear!

If it wasn't for you, we would never have got those criminals! Way to|line|go!
Welcome! Anything I can help with?|next,-4|Uh, we were wondering if you could lend us one of your umbrellas!|next,caller|The heat's starting to get to you, huh?|next|You're in luck! I DO have this old one I no longer use. It's all yours!|break||giveitem,1,167,129|
