Oh, it's you. How's the A.D.B.P. been treating you?|next,-4,Happy|It's awesome! It really helped us out!|next,caller|Heheheh. Of course. My tools are the best there is!|next,-6||anim,-4,Idle|Um, we seem to have forgotten your name.|next,caller|Oh. Hmm... Right. I'm Professor Honeycomb. Renowned scientist of |line|the Bee Kingdom!|next||anim,caller,Angry|...Or I was, until that |shaky|Doctor H.B.|shaky| took my spot!|next|H.B.'s creations all use weird tech she found studying the old roaches, you see.|next||anim,caller,Idle|Disgusting. While I do use ancient crystals, the roaches didn't create them. |line|I'd never use borrowed technology for my experiments!|next|I'll create the perfect A.D.B.P. through my own superior intellect.|next,-4|What? The Beemerang isn't good enough yet?|next,caller,Angry|Yours is nothing special. It's just one of many in the A.D.B.P. Mk II series.|next|When I finish the Mk III... They will seem like children's toys!|next,-4,Sad|What? Can't you upgrade mine again?|next,caller|I'd consider it|anim,-4,Idle|, if only because of the data you've helped me round up.|next||anim,caller,Idle|If I manage to harness the crystal energy into the prototypes... the A.D.B.P. could spin forever, generating infinite energy!|minibubble,@Incredible!,-5||next,-6|That's really not how physics work.|next,caller|And then I'd reclaim my spot as the Bee Kingdom's lead scientist!|next,-5|You have a noble goal. Won't you let us help you? In the name of science!|minibubble,@Free upgrade!,-4||next,caller,Idle|Maybe later. But for now, begone! You're getting in the way of my |line|research!|next,-4,Angry|Yikes. Fine. Let's come back later.
Oh. Hawk is back. Wonderful. He said you helped him.|next,-4,Happy|Yeah! Do we get a reward?|next,caller,Angry|No way! You already have my (stolen) prototype and want more?!|next,-4,Angry|Ugh.|next,-5|Come on, Vi. Helping is its ow-|next,-4|"Its own reward". Yeah, |anim,-4,Flustered|I've heard it before!|next,caller,Idle|Hm. You're so ungrateful, but I actually DO have something for you.|anim,-4,Idle||next,caller|As long as you're willing to gather some more data for me. Take this.|break||flag,352,true||giveitem,2,28,31|

As I thought! That's a Chomper Seed!|next,-5|Indeed. It was left behind by a Mother Chomper...|next,caller|Fascinating! Do you know how uncommon it is for seeds to |line|not bloom immediately?|next||anim,caller,Angry||flip,caller||boxstyle,1|Hawk! |shaky|HAWK!|shaky| Come here! Quick!
Have I heard correctly? You actually found an unhatched Chomper Seed...?|next,caller,Idle|Indeed! With this, maybe...|next|Yes, YES! Maybe we can make it work!|next,-4|What? What will work?|next,caller||flip,caller|Shut it and watch! Come here!

Just doing our best.|minibubble,15,-4||next,caller|I have a lot of data to analyze about the Roaches and the old |line|world now.|next|But the professor is already looking into something else.|next,-6|What would it be?|next,caller|Something on those plant creatures in Golden Hills, the Chompers.|next|They reproduce quickly through seeds. But what if we could somehow harness that seed without it hatching?|next|They seem to sprout instantly when touching a hard surface, but it should be possible to extract them if treated carefully.|next,-6|Good luck with that. We wouldn't know where to start looking.|next,caller|If you manage to find one, please bring it here. Although the professor's been trying her whole life...|next|Is such a seed truly hiding in the Golden Path...?|next,-5|We will keep it in mind, Hawk. Keep up the good work!|flag,353,true|
|anim,-4,Angry|... 
|anim,-4,Flustered||shaky|Come on!
Chompers seem to have a place where they congregate hidden somewhere in the hills.|next|We haven't been able to explore it since they are so vicious, but maybe you'd have better luck.
...! That's...|next|You must show it to the professor right away!
I've been preparing this for YEARS!|next|In front of you, you see what I call a "Chomper VAT"!|next,-6|That's just a huge chunk of glass.|next,caller|Hush! This place is just a compact environment where Chompers thrive.|next|With this, we can plant that seed right here in the lab.|next,-5|...So you wish for a pet Chomper?|next,caller,Angry|Pet?! I don't have time for that! This is |shaky|SCIENCE!|shaky||next,2|If we can somehow study how the Chompers are born and their lifestyles |line|outside of chomping bugs...|next|It would help us understand them more, and maybe even pacify them in the future.|next,-4|Sure...I really don't get how, though. Is it worth it?|next,caller,Idle|Just getting them to stop attacking travelers is a huge boon to bugdom!|next,2|We can't study them without great risks. But here, we can observe them easily.|next,-6|We do find Chompers cute. Here's hoping this works.|next,caller|That's what I like to hear! It's the moment of truth!
Success! It lives... |shaky|IT LIVES!|shaky||minibubble,21,-6||next,-5|I-Impressive! This Chomper looks a bit different though doesn't it?|next,2|Hm. My guess is that this is...|next||flip,caller|You said that you got this seed from a Mother Chomper?|next,-4|Yeah. It was a super big, super strong mama Chomper!|next,caller|I can only assume that this small one was supposed to be the next in line for that position!|next,2|Chompers do have a weird hierarchy system, but it isn't too far apart from how us bugs do it.|next|They have their Mother, we have our Queen.
Aw...such a|line|cutie.
Maybe it's because she is still young, but she seems very peaceful.|next,caller|Hm...I suppose there is some sort of imprinting in this Chomper too. It doesn't seem like it will turn violent.|next||flip,caller|You brought the seed here. Would you care to name it?|next,-6|Really? Can we?|next,2|It's only fair. We owe this incredible specimen to you.|next,caller|I'm bad with names, anyways...Go on! Name it!|break||goto,23|

Very well! Now I have another favor to ask you...|next,-4,Angry|Ugh. You're gonna have to start paying!|next,caller,Angry|This task IS the payment!|next||anim,caller,Idle|I want you to go out in the field with this Chomper and gather data on their behaviors.|next,-4|How's that a reward!? You want us to babysit a dangerous MONSTER!|next,-6|...Don't call it a monster.|next,2|She seems to have taken a liking to you three, and should be mostly harmless.|next|Maybe if she lives alongside bugs, she could grow to become a peaceful Mother Chomper.|next,-6|We don't even care if you don't agree, Vi. We're doing it. It's too cute to leave here.|next,-4,Idle|...Fine. I guess it IS a bit cute!|next,-5|Isn't it!? I cannot wait to share stories with it!|next,caller|It's settled! Come on over and take her out for a walk when you can.|next|Just bring her back into the VAT whenever, too.|next,-5|Count on us, Professor. We will ensure a bright future for this Chomper!|next,2|Treat |string,9||font,0| carefully...|line|It's quickly earned my love.
Take good care of that Chomper! We can't afford having to find another one!|next,-6|You don't need to say it twice, we will protect her with all we got.

Alright. Take care of her.

How should we name the Chomper?
