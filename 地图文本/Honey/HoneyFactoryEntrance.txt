|shaky|N-no one panic... It...it will be alright!|next|Dr. H.B. is with us... She will figure something out...!

|wavy|Oh nooooooooooooo...|wavy||next|I just got the job, and everything's already ruined. Ruined!|next|Why does this always have to happen to |wavy|meeeeeeee?!|wavy||next|With the factory closed, I can't sell stuff to fill up my quota, and I'll get fired! |wavy|Nooooooo!|wavy||next,-4|Err, management doesn't have quotas during emergencies...|next,caller||wavy|Huuu...|wavy||next,-5|Some make believe won't hurt, Vi. Miss, we'd love to shop here, if you'd have us.|next,caller|Y-you will...?|next||anim,caller,Idle|A-Alright. If there's customers, I can't mope around! I'll set the shop up!
This is the way to the factory core, but only the overseer can open the door.|next|...I've never actually seen the core itself before. Wonder how it looks like.
Oh no! The overseer's stuck in the storage! We can't gain access to the core without her!
The path on the right leads to the overseer's office.|next|Maybe you can find something to help there?
Find the overseer. Meanwhile, I will be working on the replacement key.
...This looks so complicated... B-but I can do it... 
Hmmm... Maybe the overseer's through here?
Door's locked. Needs a card or something... Where could it be?
|shaky|M-my training didn't cover this... 
Mothiva and that wasp guy entered the storage just before the lockdown...|next|Maybe they had something to do with it?

Wow! So many tourists! This is the famous Honey Factory! |next|Amazing, right? |line|Here's where we produce all of Bugaria's honey!|next|Oh, um. Ignore this pile of scrap. Some explorer left it here and |line|walked out...|minibubble,18,16||next|Anyway! I'm Tuvi, your delightful tour guide. While the incredible Doctor builds our new core, I'll show you around to lots of fun!|next,13|Yeehaw! Can't wait!|next,11||face,party,11|Sounds like a good opportunity, doesn't it?

We will enjoy this for sure!|next,-6|Knowing how the honey is made... This is an opportunity we|line|cannot miss.|next,-4|It's seriously nothing that cool...|next,-5||face,-5,-4|Maybe for a bee. For us, it's a great experience!|next,-4,Happy|Alright, alright. Geez... It'll be fun, I guess.

It's not just us, tourists and workers need to evacuate too.|next||face,party,17||anim,-6,Idle||anim,-4,Angry|Guide, do you know where the Overseer is?|next,17|N-no! It's routine checkup time...

We'll help!|next,11||anim,-4,Idle|With such a capable group of explorers here, we should be okay.|next|For now I will work on the core's replacement...

Ah! The door! Thanks, Team Snakemouth!|next,13|Heheh. It's our time to shine, Eri! Can't let them do everything, right?|next,14|Y-You sure we won't get in the way?|next,13|Relax. It's just a factory! Let's go in and do what we can!
Uh oh... The factory's super dangerous! It's full of sentry bots!|next,-5|W-What!? Team, we must give chase!
|boxstyle,6||color,5||glitchy|Welcome to the trendiest shop in all of Bugaria!
|checktrue,299,53|Poor miss Amber's been trapped as well!|next,-6|Thankfully. It'll be handy to take our items from storage.|next,-5|Think about her feelings!|next,-4|I dunno. She seems fine to me... Does she even know there's a lockdown going on?|next,-6|If she doesn't, we better not tell her.
|tail,-6|Look at 'em go.|next,-5|Goodness... They're assembling the pieces at an unbelievable pace!|next,-4|Looks like a bunch of junk. Is this really going to make a new core?|next,-5|I can't wait to see the end result!
|checkflag,176,28||checktrue,299,52||tail,-4|Yikes... Why'd you have to say that, Kabbu? Now we HAVE to |line|buy things.|next,-5|Vi, we cannot leave until we complete our mission. More supplies |line|will be helpful!|next,-4|I mean, it's not like we walked in here with our pockets empty.|next,-6|And if we run out of berries, it will be hard to get more.|next,-5|Let's just be very responsible with our exploration funds, then.
This poor bee is distressed! We simply must-|fwait,0.2||blank||tail,-4|Yeah, yeah. Let's talk to her.
|checktrue,299,56||tail,-4|Poor Tuvi...|next,-5|It must be rough, being a tour guide.|next,-6|What about us? We're the one cleaning up the mess... 
Seems at least one is frazzled...|next,-6|It'd be weird if everyone stuck to protocol.

Well, looking's free...
S-Sorry. If I give it away, I'll get fired!
Hey, you need some space for that!
Oof... That lockdown really scared me. I feel like it took a few years of my life away... 
That was the first time I've seen the core!|next|...It's nothing special, really. Bummer...
Man. This lockdown is going to make me miss my favorite show... 
I'll catch my show just in time! Thanks, Vi. |next|Just a few minutes longer, and I woulda missed it. I'm super in your debt!
Mothiva and the other dude are back! They seem a bit upset though. |line|And drenched in honey.
I went into the storage to check if everything was alright, but there's honey everywhere!|next|Do you know how long it'll take to clean that up!?
I'm glad we could help! If only we knew where the Overseer was... 
Uhh, Zasp and Mothiva... Did we upset them somehow?
You didn't hear it from me, but Gen doesn't like honey much.|next|Guess this lockdown isn't going that great for her... 
Oh, you found Mothiva! Would you know why she looks so angry?
...We owe you nothing.
Hmph. How long until we can go home!? Find the overseer already!
Took you long enough! Let's finish this dumb trip!
What a scare... I hope that Code 32 doesn't happen again.
Phew. Glad the lockdown's over.|next,-6|Now we can learn the honey making process at our leisure.|next,-4|Eh. It's better if we get going.
|tail,-4,Angry|Bleh, the store prices are so high!|next,-6|If we want honey, we could grab some ourselves.|next,-5,Angry|That's theft! Cease and |wavy|desist|wavy|!
I'm glad Lady Amber is here to help.|next,-6|Do you think the Bee Kingdom pays her to be here?|next,-4|I wonder if we could get paid to make Kabbu carry bags... 
Malbee? I think she's chatting with the Overseer.
It's a relief to have other teams here with us...|next,-4|THEY should be relieved we decided to come along!|next,-6|Why not both? We'll have to work together to get through this.|next,-4|Meh. If you say so...
Tuvi's in high spirits!|next,-6|We're surprised. She looks although nothing's happened.|next,-4|I'm surprised she didn't quit...
