There it is... The factory's core!
So this is the core... It's a bit unsightly.|next,2|Heh. It was definitely designed with function over form.|next,3|This is such a big day! The core's never been replaced!|next|If this goes awry, the whole factory will explode...

Huff... What an exhausting tour that was. |anim,-5,Idle|But it was fun, too.|next,-4|You've got a real weird idea of fun.|next,-6|We should go hand over this artifact. Let's go, everyone.
Mission Complete! We can finally leave!|next,9|Yeah, yeah... Can we have the old core? To give to the Queen, of course.|minibubble,22,-4||flip,-4||next,2,Idle||flip,2||flip,3|Of course.
This is the core room.|next,-4|We know, Kabbu.|next,-6|Back in the day, we heard the factory was powered with caterpillars running to spin wheels...|next,-5|Is that even possible?|next,-4|Yep. But then the core got built a few moons after the roaches disappeared.|next,-5|Bless science. Think of how tired those caterpillars must have been!
The Overseer's here... Let's exchange the core!
My hands hurt...but we finished the core in time!
|tail,-6|They built an ancient artifact replica in...like an hour? Incredible.|next,-5|Bee scientists have truly earned their fame!|next,-4|...Yeah.
