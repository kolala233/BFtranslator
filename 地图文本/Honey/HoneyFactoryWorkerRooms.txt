|checkpos,x,-20,1||checktrue,218,29||tail,-6|Call it a hunch, but we think this is the Overseer's office.|next,-4|Mhm.|next,-5|Incredible! How did you figure it out!?|next,-6|...A hunch.|next,-5|...Oh. Ahem. Vi, there's no way the Overseer would be hiding in here, right?|next,-4|I sure hope so. Would make our life way easier.|next,-6|Then she's definitely not here. But let's look around anyways.
So many beds! Are these needed with the Hive close by?|next,-4|Workers don't really leave the factory until their shift's over. |line|Sometimes its days long...|next,-6|That sounds suffocating. And illegal.|next,-4|Pays super well, though! And then they go on a huge holiday!|next,-5|How come you didn't become a worker, then? It'd get you all the berries you want.|next,-4,Angry|No way! It's so boring! Once was enough for a lifetime!|next,-4,Flustered|I wanted to fall asleep every second of it! I'd rather be poor!|next,-6|Alrighty then...
|checkmapflag,0,5|Hey, normally tourists can't sleep here... But it's an emergency. |line|Care for a nap?|prompt,map,0.5,2,3,4,@Yes.,@No.|
Alright, I'll wake you if something happens.|break||mapflag,0,true||resetregion||innsleep,-58.25,0,1.15,true|
Do be careful.
Had a good rest? Hopefully we'll get out soon... 
Watch out with the honey! It's super-sticky, and the machines here |line|charge it with |color,1|numbing|color,0| electricity!|next|If some turret shoots it at you, make sure to block!
|tail,-6|A portrait of the overseer? A bit narcissistic...|next,-4|It's not like that. This is the honored employee portrait!|next|Bees that work really hard get to be put up there for a few days.|next,-5|Is there no hall of fame for all the honored employees?|next,-4|Yup. It's inside the Hive though, so you two can't see em.|next,-6|So in our team, Kabbu would be the honored employee?|next,-5|I-I would?|next,-4|No way, it'd be me!|next,-6|(...Awaiting nomination...)|discovery,15||flag,223,true|

Psst. Vi. I know we're stuck, but if you need any |color,1|Magic Seeds|color,0|...Fork over 25 berries...|showmoney||prompt,map,2,2,11,12,@Hand it over!,@No way!|
|checkmoney,25,13||checkinvqtd,0,full,14||money,-25|Alright then... Here it is.|break||giveitem,0,11,-11|
If you need them just come see me.
Sorry, can't make the deal any cheaper. Not even for you, Vi.
Oops. Seems you can't carry anything else.
Phew, Glad the lockdown's over! Thought we were going to be stuck here forever...|next|What? Magic Seeds? No idea what you're talking about, Vi. H-Hahaha!
Lockdown's over... Back to work we go!
Sorry, tourists can't sleep in here. If you get hired back, Vi, I'll make sure to save a bed for you.|next,-4,Angry|Fat chance.
I'll revise the protocols so that lockdowns won't happen on |line|important days... 
|tail,-4|That's the overseer!|next,-6|Yeah, we saved her, remember?
|call,28||tail,10|Oh, Vi! You've come back!|next,-4,Angry|This might pay well, so...|next,-6|The robot things are having issues, yeah?|next,9|Indeed. The Code 32 incident caused plenty of trouble, and I had to fix all of them.|next|The Menders are durable and reliable, but some of them went haywire despite my efforts.|next|I don't have time to look for all of them, so I need you to go in my stead.|next,-5|We're not qualified engineers, so... How do we fix the Menders?|next,9|Easy. Just whack them until their system resets.|next,-5|What? H-Hit them? What about their feelings!?|next,-6|Kabbu, machines don't have feelings.|anim,-5,WeakBattleIdle||minibubble,21,-5||next,9||destroyminibubble|They don't indeed. Just go and reset them, no matter how many whacks it takes.|next|There should be |color,1|3|color,0| around the processing areas of the factory.|next,-4,Idle|You better have a reward ready! Let's move, team!|breakend|
And if |line|they do...?|halt|
There are 3 broken Menders in the factory's processing area. Trust me, one |line|look and you'll know which ones broke.
The Menders normally just follow their programming, but sometimes they can go a bit... crazy.|next|Pay no mind to their babbling while in that state.
|call,28||tail,9|You've fixed them, haven't you? My radar's confirmed it.|next,-5|It was emotionally draining...|next,10|The Menders weren't made to fight, only to do simple tasks.|next||anim,10,Sad|Thank you. H.B.'s inventions have been going |wavy|way|wavy| out of control recently.|next,9,Angry|Well, I must congratulate you, Vi. I really want you to come back and work for us.|next,-4,Flustered|In your dreams!|next,-4,Happy|Exploring's right where I belong.|next,9,Idle|...Regardless of my bias, it's good to see you've found your calling.|next|You've earned this.

|tail,-4,Happy|Woah! This one's really rare!|next,10,Idle|It would really be nice to have you back with us, Vi. But I know you'd hate it...|next|Good luck on your adventures!|next,-4|Thanks, chief!|next,-6|Well, we're out. Stay safe.|completequest,35||flag,330,true|
I do think you've got a future here, Vi.|next,-4,Happy|I'll live. Exploring's way more fun!
Thank you. That's one less problem to worry about!
