|checkflag,211,6|The pump is a fascinating piece of technology!|next,-6|It makes the Golden Settlement look way behind the times.|next,-4|I dunno. It just looks weird and ugly to me.|next,-5|What's its appearance got to do with anything...?

Glad you still remember that.|next|Who are those two with you?|next,-6|Vi's exploration team.|next,-5|At your service!|next,caller,Idle|So you did go and build up a team instead of doing your shift here, didn't ya?|next,-4,Flustered|Anything is better than here! Bet you never saw it coming either!|next,caller|I didn't. The Vi from back then wouldn't have managed.|next,-4||shaky|HEY!|shaky||next,caller|Guess something changed, though...|next|It seems that I owe ya in the end. So thanks. Who knows what could've happened.|next,-4,Angry|You're...welcome?|next,-5|Uh, I'm glad we could be of help.|next|By the way, Miss Malbee. We're looking for the Overseer. Would you be able to help us?|next,caller|Oh, her? She's got to be trapped in the Storage.|next|With the security in place, the vents shut down... Honey's heating up, and those Abomihoneys are popping up.|next|She won't last long by herself.|next,-6|What do we do? The storage is locked.|next,caller|That's because the pump shut down. I was about to fix it, when I got jumped...|next,-4,Idle|Can you fix it now?|next,caller|Yup. Hang on tight for a few minutes.
Is it done?|next,caller,Angry|Yep! Good as new. Processing's back to full power! Storage should be open, too.|next,-5|Thank you!

We do get to tour around after all!|next,-4||face,party,caller||anim,-5,Idle|Thanks, Malbee. We're gonna go do our mission and stuff.|next,caller,Angry|Hmph.
