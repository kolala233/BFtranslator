|checktrue,555,1||tail,-6|Fancy...and empty around here.|next,-4,BattleIdle|We can charge straight ahead!|next,-5|Let's be careful. Even if they haven't noticed us yet, this is too convenient...
|tail,-6|It's bustling around here.|next,-4|Well, there's lots to do!|next,-5|It seems we cannot enter their residential area anymore.|next|Given the state it was in, it may need some repair...
|align,right,true||face,caller,-5|Ah, it's my heroes!|next,-6||checktrue,461,9|Hey, Jayde. Looking good.|next,caller|With the crisis over, I can follow my passion! Selling stew!|next,-4|What, like a shop?|next,caller|My stew shop! You guys liked it so much...I think it can be a success!|next,-6|You've got that right.|next,caller|I'll give you a special Ranger Discount, so buy a lot!|next,-4||anim,-4,Happy|Woohoo!|next,-5||anim,-5,WeakBattleIdle|W-We're not...!|next,caller|You don't have to say anything! It's my way of thanking you for everything!|flag,461,true||flag,643,true|
|showmoney||align,right,true|Rangers! Come for some stew? It's 20 berries, just for you. Hero discount!|prompt,map,0,2,4,5,@Yes please!,@No thanks!|
|checkmoney,20,6||checkinvqtd,0,full,7||money,-20|All done! Have a feast!|break||giveitem,0,120,8|
Aw...well. I'll be around. Come by anytime if you want some!
Oh, sorry. I can't go any lower, even for you...
Ah! You can't carry anything else. Maybe I could...keep any of your |line|old hero items?
You can come back anytime, my heroes!
We see you've come back to your homeland.|next,caller|Yup, nothing beats home! ...When it's at peace, anyways.|next,-4|You gonna keep selling stew? It's super good!|next,caller|Yup. It really is my passion!|next,-5|It will be our pleasure to keep eating it!|next,caller|Hehehe. Help yourselves, my heroes!|flag,643,true|
Hngh, now that everything's over, we should probably tell her...|next,-4|And lose the discount!? No way!|next,-6|Kabbu. At this point, we're actual heroes. Is there a point?|next,-5,WeakBattleIdle|It's a matter of principle...!
Those prisons held so many innocent...I hope we can make amends.
The usurper left our structures very uncared for. It will take time to make |line|them presentable.
|tail,-4|So what's Wasp culture like?|next,-6|Y'know, we're not sure...|next,-5|Because they've been closed off for so long, I figured they were very violent...|next,-4|Doesn't seem like it, right?|next,-6|Hopefully we can learn more about them, now that there's peace.
Queen Vanessa would be most pleased to see you!
We owe you so much...but do behave in front of the queen!
|tail,-6|Seems our intruding didn't hurt their relationship.|next,-5|I'm so relieved! If I was the cause for a breakup, I...|next,-4,Happy|...'d apologize a lot. Right?|next,-5,WeakBattleIdle|...Yes.
The royal halls are some good stuff. Hopefully we can get a house soon, though.
Mmm...I'm glad sis is doing fine.|next|I gotta start thinking of moving, though. Can't be a third wing forever!
Let's be patient, Rebelle. We'll live together soon!
We can only let you access these halls for now...but make yourselves comfortable.
The usurper caused unmeasurable damage to our community. We must stay united if we're to recover.
|wavy|Hehehe.|wavy| They let me in...! I can hang around Wasps all day!
I'm glad peace has come to the Wasp Kingdom. Otherwise, I'd...worry for her.|next,-6|Hopefully she doesn't get thrown into prison again...
