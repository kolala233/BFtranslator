Welcome back, challengers! Are you ready to try the Cave of Trials?
We're ready.
Not yet.
How does this work?
What do we get?
|color,5|This terminal will use your crystal's data to let you battle many foes in consecutive battles.|next||color,5|If your crystal has no data on our enemies, they will show up as silhouettes. My apologies.|next||color,5|You can only heal every 10 battles, and holographic enemies |line|award less EXP.|next||color,5|Every 10 battles completed awards a prize, and it's safe to fail.|next||color,5|So keep changing your strategy until you come out on top!
|color,5|For each 10 completed Trials, you get special items, Medals or berries that may aid you in your journey.|next||color,5|There is no penalty for losing, so feel free to try as much as you need to win!|next||color,5|But beware, giving up before reaching a 10 battle milestone will net |line|you nothing. Try to endure until then!|next||color,5|Also, do not worry about spending your items, as they will be returned just how they were at the end of the battle! So use away!
|color,5|Cold feet? Come back if you decide to challenge the Trial again!
The current data does not allow for the full run of the Trial, currently the system goes up to tier |var,0|. Is this okay?
|color,5|Very well! Let's load up the Trial program!
Battle @VAR@ of @VAR2@, let's go!
Congrats on making it this far! Still @VAR@ battles to go through, however.
Do you want to keep going?
ERROR. INSUFFICIENT DATA.|next||color,5|I am sorry. You cannot continue as we no longer have any data for new challenges!|next||color,5|Please gather more data and come back!
Here is something for your efforts.
|call,9|There is always next time, challengers! I do hope you return!
Is the challenge too tough? Always keep trying new Medal combinations to see what you can do!
Well, here is something for your efforts anyway!
Congratulations! Here comes the next challenge!
|color,5|Very well, here is some healing before we continue ahead!

You deserve something for your efforts!|next||color,5|Once you are done, check near the platform, you should find something of interest.
You did it! Congratulations! You have successfully completed the Cave of Trials!|next||color,5|It brings me joy that I can reward you with this, take it!
|call,9|But your journey is still far from over, my friends.|next||color,5|If you want to keep fighting, just talk to me again, and we shall begin the process once more.|next||color,5|I no longer possess any amazing rewards, but you shall still earn berries, |line|so feel free to come back anytime!
