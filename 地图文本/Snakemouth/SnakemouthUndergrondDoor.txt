|checkflag,35,1||tail,-6|The door's open. Hopefully there's not another trapdoor...|next,-5|The one before got you as well?|next,-6|Yeah... We fell straight unto the floor. The rest is history.|next,-5|(Not a mushroom...?)|next,-4|Okay. I'll go check it out first.|next|If there's another trap, I can just fly out of it!|next,-5|Heh. Thank you, Vi.
|tail,-4|This room is gigantic!|next,-5|Indeed. It's hard to know where to go.|next,-6|When in doubt, go left.|next,-4|No way, right is right!|next,-5|Given the way this cave has been laid out...|next|I believe we will have to go both ways.|next,-6|What a drag...|next,-4|No joke. Let's rest up and then explore some more!
EEP!
It's not funny! I'm all soaked now!|next,-5|S-Sorry, Vi. I couldn't help it. |anim,-5,Idle|It seems the ceiling's dripping...|next,-4,Angry|Ugh, why is there so much water in here!? Under us, above us...|anim,-4,Flustered|it doesn't make sense!|next,-6|Hm. This is good, though.|next,-5|What do you mean?|next,-6|If it's water... 
Then it can be frozen.|next,-5|Impressive! If you can do that, it opens a lot of options for us!|next|I bet I can |color,1|push them with my horn|color,0|, as well.|next,-4|That's pretty cool, Leif!|next,-6|Mhm. Enemies, the water around us... Even though they seem like obstacles, we can exploit them for |line|our own benefit.|next,-5|Let's give your ice magic a try on all we can find.
|checktrue,586,9||tail,-6|The craftmanship on this statue is pretty good. Compared to everything else, at least.|next,-5|That it is. It's a shame this monument outlived its creators.|next,-4|Yeah. You only hear about roaches in folk tales nowadays...|next,-6|Pardon? When did the roaches disappear?|next,-4|A bit before I was born, I think.|next,-6|So pretty recently?|minibubble,8,-4||anim,-4,Flustered||next,-5|It was indeed quite a recent event. No one knows for sure the how or why, however.|next,-4,Angry|This is depressing talk. We should really find a way out!|next,-6|(...This can't be right...)|breakend|
|boxstyle,4|An old statue.
|checkflag,25,-23||boxstyle,3||spd,0|When at a loss on what to do, the |button,9| button can give you the hint you've been looking for!
|shaky|HEY!|shaky|
|tail,-6|The craftmanship on this statue is pretty good. Compared to everything else, at least.|next,-5|That it is. It's a shame this monument outlived its creators.|next,-4|Maybe they fled to the Giant's Lair?|next,-6|Dunno. We could ask them later.|next,-5|Indeed. For now, let us finish our mission.
