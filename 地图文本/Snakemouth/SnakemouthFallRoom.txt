Nghgh...|next||tail,-4|No rush. I can wait.

And there doesn't seem to be a way back up for me. |line|We will have to look around.|next,-4||face,-4,-5|Let's be careful, okay? You were almost a goner!
Yikes... Is that a moth?|next||tail,-5|By the Queen! What a terrible fate... A moment of silence, in solidarity for a fallen explorer.

I will properly scold you later. The situation is dire, but I've got a plan.|next|We will attack the |color,1|web|color,0| holding the moth while battling the spider.|next,-4|And we bail when we free him?|next,-5|Precisely. Except we'll run together, this time. Without leaving anyone behind.|minibubble,34,-4||breakend|

This crystal... It's an ancient artifact. Although it's too heavy to carry.|next|It was used to |color,1|record|color,0| where people have walked through.|next|Since this one is yellow, it will |color,1|heal our HP and TP|color,0| too. Try smacking it sometime.|next||tail,-5|Alright. Now let us depart for real!
We're trapped. Well, I am.|next|How shameful, to make Vi come to such a dangerous place.|next||tail,-4|Look, I can take care of myself. Don't make me regret coming with you.|next||tail,-5|Sorry, I shouldn't undermine your choice. Let's press forward!
|tail,-6|This is the spider's den. Also known as our second home.|next||tail,-4|It must have sucked, being trapped in that web.|next||tail,-5|Not really, it was surprisingly cozy.|next||tail,-6|Mhm. Quite good to nap in.|next||tail,-4|Seriously!?|next||tail,-6|If we stay any longer, you'll get to enjoy the soft silk, too.|next||tail,-4|No no no no NO! We're |shaky|leaving!
|boxstyle,1|Leave us alone already, monster! 
Truly? It seems we owe our life to you, Vi.|minibubble,24,-5||next||destroyminibubble||tail,-4|No big deal. |anim,-4,Angry|It sucks that we're trapped, though.|next||destroyminibubble||tail,-5||face,1,-5|Were you looking for treasure as well, alongside fellow explorers? Err, what's your name?|next||tail,1|Leif is fine. And somewhat. A scouting mission, in fact.|next,-4||face,1,-4|You've got some luck to be alive... Did you learn anything scouting? About the artifact?|next||tail,1|Artifact? If it is here, it's probably ahead.|next,-5||face,1,-5|If we work together, we will surely find both it and the exit!
Seriously!?|halt|
We have little choice. We will accompany you.|next||tail,-5|Can you fight?|next||tail,1|...Not really part of scouting. |next||tail,-4||anim,-4,Flustered|Seriously!? You came into this place without knowing how to fight!?|next||tail,-5|Make sure to stay behind us, so we can protect you. |next||tail,1|How reassuring.|next||tail,-4||anim,-4,Idle||face,1,-4|Ok. We've spent too much time here. |flip,-4|Let's look for the exit!
Wait.|next||tail,-5||face,-5,1||face,-4,1|Is something the matter?
This has to be some cruel irony...|line|However, I can't give up, even if I'm alone!
I-It's too much by myself, after all...
Vi! Vi, wait! Curses!
H-Here it comes. Let's do this!
|wavy|Cough cough
Let's turn over a new leaf, Vi. This moth is our priority.
|tail,-4,Angry|You wanna get eaten by the spider!? We're not going back!
I apologized already!|halt|
