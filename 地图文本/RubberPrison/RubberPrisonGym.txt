A training facility?|next,-6|A gym, Kabbu.|next,-5|They allow prisoners to stay fit and healthy!?|next,-4|It's not like that'll help them break out...
Ugh. Making sure no one steals this equipment all day... I hate this job.
Hehe. You look like fresh meat. What are you in for?|next|Huh, what? You're explorers? Uhhh... I said nothing, I'm innocent. |line|I swear!
|tail,-6|Didn't we meet this one in the Bandits' Hideout?|next,-5|Hm? We didn't turn any of them in, though...|next,-4|Wonder what he did to end up here...
All I wanted was just to eat good food for no effort. Joined the bandits, then ended here.|next|And you know what? This is much better than I imagined. I wish I was arrested sooner.

I was sure I'd get beaten up for being a pushover. I mean, it definitively happened, but it wasn't as bad as I |line|thought it'd would be.
|tail,-4|Prison's rough for the weak villains, huh.|next,-5|Sadly, not many think about that before ending up here...
|shaky|O-Oh! Team Snakemouth! T-This isn't what it looks like, I swear!
|tail,-6|So love can bloom between chaos and order.|next,-5|...Let's go.
