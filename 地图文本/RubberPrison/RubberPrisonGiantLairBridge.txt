|checkflag,79,34||tail,-6|Giant's Lair is up ahead. Is there really no info at all?|next,-5|None. It had been sealed even before Elizant arrived, they say.|next,-4|No wonder it fell with one swing.|next,-6|Ancient doors are super high quality. We think the king's just a brute.
...! Everyone! The Wasp King's up ahead!
Such poor defenses. This is to be expected from those Ants!
Stop right there! You're done!|next,4|How many times must I knock you down before you learn?|next,-6|Third time's the charm, eh?|next,4|I don't have time to deal with vermin.|next||shaky||line||size,1.5||boxstyle,1|ULTIMAX!

Tch. Let's follow his advice. Quick and painful.|next,5|Your journey ends here! At the hands of GENERAL ULTIMAX!
N-No! You won't pass! No one can pass!!!|next,-4|Knock it off! You already lost!|next,5,Chase||shaky|NO ONE WILL PASS! THOSE ARE THE KING'S ORDERS!|next||anim,this,BattleIdle|I...I HAVE TO FOLLOW THE KING'S ORDERS!|next|I...I MUST FOLLOW...|shaky||next,-5|T-This isn't normal!|next,-6|That Wasp in the kingdom said everyone'd gone nuts...|next|Could this one be controlled too?|next,-4,Flustered|Just let us pass!|next,5|YOU WILL HAVE TO CRUSH MY BODY!
...That works.|next,-6||flip,-6|That king employs such distasteful tactics.|next|Let's leave this poor guy to the Ant Kingdom.|next,-5|Indeed. Let's secure the area so reinforcements can come in.|next|Then, we'll have to give swift chase!|next|I will send the signal!
Ohohoho! The cavalry's here! Aren't you glad?
Great work clearing the way, Team Snakemouth!|next,eri|Yeah. It's gonna be smooth sailing from here!|next,maki|We cannot celebrate yet. The Wasp King is brutally powerful.|next,kina|He's gonna pay for bruising you!|next,yin|Muh muh!|next,elizant|Indeed. But for now, we are fortunate to have gotten this far.|next,vanessa|Are we sure it's alright with everyone having come?|next,elizant||flip,elizant|Queen Bianca has gracefully offered to protect the Ant Kingdom while we fulfill this mission.|next,-4||flip,elizant|Woah, I thought she was a super pacifist!|next,zasp,Angry|Can't reason with a mad bug.|next,elizant|My knights and trusted explorers! Make your final preparations. We venture into Giant's Lair - No Bug's Land!|next|None have returned from it. We have no legends, no way to know what's inside.|next|But if we do not face this challenge, we don't deserve tomorrow's freedom! Let us pray to Venus and|line|charge!|next,levi|What a magnificent rally! I'm pumped up!|next,-6|Hmm. She's come far, hasn't she?|next,-5|Even you were moved, eh Leif?|next,-4|Time to kick some butt!|next,vanessa|It's time...Bugaria will be saved today, but I too will reclaim my people. Let's go!|next,mothiva|Idols first!
Some explorers are out doing some business... Just wish they'd be done already, this is serious!
|checktrue,423,10||checktrue,131,10|Looks like everyone is here... Let's stop the Wasp King!
...This is the entrance to the Giant's Lair. Team Snakemouth... Be careful!
Team Snakemouth.
May we be of service, Queen Vanessa?|next,caller|While you ventured into the Termite Kingdom, I did some studying of my|line|own.|next|I think the Wasp King is hiding something. The source of his strength...|next|It probably lies in his crown.|next,-4|Huh? How's a crown gonna pump you up?|next,caller|Before I explain, I want you to have this.
|noskip||spd,0.05|The Wasp Queen has entrusted you|line|with the |color,1|Flame Brooch|color,0|!
What is this amulet? It feels so...warm.|next,caller|This is the Wasp Kingdom's royal heirloom. My mother gave it to me, and|line|told me to protect it no matter what.|next,-5|Queen! Is it really alright for us to have this?|next,caller|Of course. See, this emblem's been protecting me all this time...|next,-4|I don't get how this is gonna help.|next,caller|This amulet's magical. I don't know how, but it always protected me against the Wasp King's flames.|next|I am not a fighter, but you will most likely need this more than I do now.|next,-5|We will safeguard it. It is an honor to be trusted with a royal treasure!|next,caller|Be safe. And beat the heck out of that usurper!
|anim,-5,Happy|Everybody's here!|next,-4|Yeah! We're good enough, but this is great!|next,-6|It's very reassuring. Heh. We've made good friends.|next,-5|We cannot afford to lose, for all of their sakes!
|wavy|Ohohoho!|wavy||next,-6|Have you chosen to laugh just because?|next,caller|I'm just delighted. We're going to be famous!|next|The books will speak of the great Mothiva's valiant role in saving Bugaria!|next,-4|Yah. In a little corner next to our portrait!|next,caller,Angry|We'll see about that, runt.|next,-5|We'll see indeed. But today, we are comrades.|anim,caller,Idle|
We're on even standing, Team Snakemouth.|next,-6|You're too decent to tag along with Mothiva.|next,caller|That's for me to decide.|next,-4|Look. Whatever. Just beat a bunch of baddies up!|next,caller,Angry|Hah! That's the plan. Break a leg.|next,-5|B-Break a leg?|next,caller|...It uh, it means good luck.
Heh. I've been polishing my darts...|next|That jerk messed with the wrong family!

You'll have to share the tale over some food when we're done.
Team Snakemouth. There is nothing left to say, as my orders are clear.|next|...But thank you, for escorting me through the Forsaken Lands.|next,-6|Thank you, our Queen, for making the journey. It's thanks to you we got the submarine.|next,caller|It was my duty and honor. I hope you will escort me once more.|next,-4|Count on it!|minibubble,@Certainly!,-5||breakend|

Hm... We still have something to do, but I suppose that can wait.
Let's get this over with, we have some more pressing matters to resolve afterwards.
Thank you, Team Snakemouth. The entire Ant Kingdom is in your debt!
|anim,-5,Surprized|T-They should install a fence here! What a terrifying post!|next,-4,Flustered|Or ask a Hive soldier! At least they can fly!
