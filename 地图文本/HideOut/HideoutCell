|checktrue,18,3||tail,-4,Angry|This place sucks! And they keep bugs in here?|next,-5|This is a prison. Our comfort is of the lowest priority.|next,-6|At least they were nice enough to not fix the leak. We've got water to drink.|next,-4,Flustered|No! No way! I ain't drinking that! We're getting OUT!
|face,-4,-6||face,-6,-4||tail,-4|...This cell's really well sealed...|minibubble,@Hmm...,-5||next,-6||destroyminibubble|It doesn't seem like our ice magic will help, either. |anim,-5,Angry||minibubble,@HMMM...,-5|At least there's water to drink.|next||face,-4,-5|Uh, you okay there?|next,-5,Idle||destroyminibubble|I've got an idea!|fwait,0.2||flip,-5| Vi, Leif, humor me one moment.|next,-4,Idle|Not much else to do, really.|next,-5|This is |color,1|soft soil|color,0|. I could |color,1|dig|color,0| us out of here!|anim,-4,Sad||minibubble,@D-Dig?,-4||next,-6|Can you really? Sounds pretty time consuming.|next,-5|You should know beetles are fantastic diggers! If you stick |line|with me, we'll be out in no time.|next,-4|Ugh...Is this the only way? My fur's gonna get all dirty!|next,-6|We could stay here and starve, Vi.|next,-4,Surprized|A-Alright. Let's dig it up!|next,-5|Wonderful! |anim,-4,Idle|Remember, if we are on a |color,1|spot with soft dirt|color,0|, I can dig by |color,1|holding down |button,5||color,0|.|next|This will let us go |color,1|under certain objects and hide from enemies|color,0|.|next,-6|Say, how come you never brought this up?|next,-5|We didn't really need it, did we?|next,-4,Happy|All that matters is we're getting outta this cell.|next,-4,Flustered|But we've gotta go find our stuff too!|minibubble,@Mission start.,-6||minibubble,@Onward!,-5||breakend|
Kabbu can now |color,1|dig|color,0|! Hold down |button,5| on soft dirt to dig under objects and hide from enemies!|next|Digging out near certain |color,1|dirt spots|color,0| will make them |color,1|pop out an item|color,0|, so be on the lookout for these!|next||sound,ItemGet0|Kabbu can now also use the |color,1|Under Strike|color,0| skill in battle!
|tail,-4|Digging's not my favorite, but it beats being stuck in a cell.|next,-6|You're pretty good, given how rusty you must be.|next,-5|Oh, it's one of those things you just can't forget. It was nice to dig again, actually.|next,-4|Let's just, uh, try to keep it to the minimum!
|tail,-4|Why are we back here again?|next,-6|Eh. Just in case. Doesn't hurt to walk around.
|anim,-4,Sad||anim,-6,WeakBattleIdle||shaky|Hurk...|shaky|We were careless.|next,-4,Flustered|They took my Beemerang!|next,-6|All our belongings, as well.|next,-5||anim,-6,Idle|What a disgrace! I should've been more aware...I've put you both in |line|danger.|next,-4,Angry|Stop being melodramatic!|fwait,0.2||anim,-4,Idle| Let's look around. We'll figure something |line|out!|next,-6|Perk up, Kabbu. You can't let Vi beat you at pep talks.|next,-5|...You're right.|fwait,0.2||anim,-5,Happy| You two really are a great team! Let's search every nook and cranny!

My name is Cerise!|next,-4,Angry||wavy|Oooookayyyy...|wavy| The heck were you doing underground?!|next,caller||bleep,5,2.5|I came to this weird land looking for my boyfriend Tanjy!|next|...But I got really sleepy, so I dug a hole to take a nap in!|next|And monsters can't see you if you can't see them, you know?|next,-5,Idle|That's...not how it works, but alright.|next,-4,Idle|Weird. I thought you were a prisoner too...|next,caller||bleep,5,2.5|What's a prisoner?|next,-6|Oh no. She's not too smart.|next,caller||bleep,5,2.5|I also found this weirdly shiny berry while digging. Doesn't taste very good though!|next|You can have it if you want, Uncle Iron Seed.
|bleep,5,2.5|Hiding underground keeps you safe from monsters. But I just wish I could dig through solid rock...|next,-5|Indeed. It's quite a pain to be unable to dig past troublesome enemies at times.|next,caller||bleep,5,2.5|It also helps you find rare stuff like that weirdly shiny berry I gave you, Uncle Iron Seed.|next|And sometimes, you can even find weird cherries that like to sleep underground...|next,-4|Kinda like you, right?|next,caller||bleep,5,2.5|...? I'm not a cherry...|next,-6|Stop it, Vi. You're confusing the poor girl.
|tail,-5,instant|Uncle Iron...what?|next,caller||bleep,5,2.5|Uncle Iron Seed! Because you look like an Iron Seed, and you look old enough to be my uncle.|anim,-4,Happy||minibubble,@Pfft...,-4||next|But...you don't look strong enough to have been eating lots of Iron Seeds, though...|next,-5,WeakBattleIdle|......We should get going.|next,caller,Happy||bleep,5,2.5|Okie-love-you-bye-bye! I'll go outside and look for Tanjy in a little bit,|line|so don't worry about me!|next,-6|We won't...too much.|breakend|
|checktrue,682,11|Should we wake her up?|next,-4,Angry|...
|tail,-4,Happy||shaky|PFFTHAHAHAHAHA! "UNCLE IRON SEED"?!|shaky||next,-5,Hurt|Oh, be quiet...|next,-4,Idle|She kinda looks like one of those rare Dark Cherries. But red. That's weird.|next,-6|She's more like a shade of pink. And we think it's cute, not weird.|next|If she's really a cherry, maybe that's why she naps underground...|next,-5,Idle|I've heard that there's a land to the far east where bugs resemble various fruits. Perhaps she's from there?|next,-4|Oh, yeah! Like in those fairy tales... |next|Their cherries are red and grow from trees, not the ground! They must cost a fortune!|next,-6|...Then why is she napping underground? Maybe we'll find |line|answers if we visit her land...|next,-5|...Just this once, perhaps we shouldn't explore?
|tail,-4,Surprized|W-What the...?!|next,-5,Angry|Those accursed bandits, burying a poor bug alive like that!|next,-6|...Actually, we think she's just asleep.|next,-5,Idle||anim,-4,Idle|Oh. Should we wake her?
