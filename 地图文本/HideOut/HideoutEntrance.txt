V-Vi! Leif!
...So you're the ones causing all this ruckus. Team Snakemouth.|next,-5|This imposing presence! Are you the leader of the bandits?|next,caller|Hm. Quite sharp.
My name is Astotheles. As you say, I lead this pack.|next,-4|You've got some nerve throwing us in a cell!|next,-6|If you give us the key, we may even forgive it.|next,caller|As if your feelings were of my slightest concern. You were trapped for what your heads could offer.
You are the Ant Witch's lackeys. My sworn enemies, and your capture could be a gold mine for my people.|next|The Wasps promised a handsome |line|reward if we got rid of you.|line|But I was blind to their slimy ways.|next,-5|Astotheles, you seem reasonable. Surely this needs not come to blows?|next,2|You naive Queen's lapbug. Between us there can be |line|no compromise.|next|But you shall have an honorable fight. Do your worst!|minibubble,@Curses...,-5||next,-6|Have it your way.|minibubble,@Let's do it!,-4||breakend|

We bet our honor in battle, and I lost. They're free to go.|next,5|Seriously, boss? We can take 'em!|next,2|...It's okay, friends. The gardens bloom, do they not? And we drove the wasps out.|next|There's no point in keeping them here any longer.|next,-4,Angry|So you've come around? You could've just let us go, you know?|next,7|I don't get ya sometimes, boss...|next,2|You three. You're against the Wasps, correct?|next,-5|Indeed. They are a threat to all of Bugaria.|next,2|Then you may not be so bad. Maybe I can trust you with this.
|face,5,-1||face,6,-1||face,7,-1|We don't owe the Ant Kingdom even one blade of grass...|next|But those Wasps betrayed our covenant. They are lower than dirt.|next|I hope they'll meet justice at your hands. We don't have the time or resources to go after them.|next,-6|If we do, don't think it's to do you a favor.|next,2|With that key, your mercy is repaid. Now, get out. If you come back, we'll throw you in that cell again.|minibubble,@We'd break out again!,-4||next,5|You heard the boss! Get out! Don't make us kick ya!|next,-6|You bandits have got some swinging moods.|next,-4,Sad|I don't get it... Are they good or bad?|next,-5||flip,-4||flip,-5||flip,-6|Come, Vi. I don't think that's an answer we'll get today... 
...I have no more business with you. Get out.
Careful. We're in bandit territory!
