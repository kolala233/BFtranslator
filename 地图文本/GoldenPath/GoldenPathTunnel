|tail,-6|This place is dreadful. Pretty sad, if you ask us.|next,-4|It's not like anyone comes here often, you know? It does the job.|next,-5|Indeed. If we cross quickly, we can leave behind this gray scenery.

Scarlet is just ahead. Are you ready to confront him? It won't |line|be easy...|prompt,map,1.85,2,-11,4,@We are ready!,@Not yet.|
|tail,14|Then get ready soon, or he might get away!
Excellent. He is just through here.|minibubble,@Huh?,-5||next,-4,Sad|Uhh... All I see is a wall?|next,-6|Hmm. We can feel some faint magic, though.|next,13|You see...this wall is but an illusion.|next|Scarlet disguises the area up ahead from the common folk so he can hide there. Only his prey don't see it.|next|He only attacks when the victim accepts his request... That's why I |line|cannot see the wall.|next,14|It's no wonder we couldn't find him, but when Levi picked up that suspicious quest...|next|Well, the pieces came together.|next,-5|W-Wait, you mean Levi is Scarlet's target? That's crazy!|next,13|Please, calm yourself. I understand the risks. But if we follow|line|the plan, we can capture him.|next,14|Levi will go ahead by himself, to drop Scarlet's guard.|next|Then, we will jump him while he's distracted.|next,-4|A-Are you sure? He could really hurt you!|next,13|You have my trust. We are five, and he is but one.|next,-6|...Got it. Let's do it, then.|next,14|Glad you understand. Let's begin the mission!
We should talk to Levi and Celia once we are ready to fight Scarlet... 
W-WOAH...!|next,14|Shush!|anim,-4,Angry| Don't screw this up!|next,-6|Yeah, Vi. Shhhhhh.|next,-4|Drop it, Leif.
Ah!~ Has a dashing explorer finally heard my plea?~
Greetings. You're...Rogu, the one who posted this notice?|next|I've come to hear what troubles you.|next,15|My, my! So direct and to the point... 
You're too tense, dear...|next|Just relax. That is how you can help me...~|next,13,Surprized|I-|flip,13| Uh...|flip,13| W-What? Am I in the wrong place?|next,15|Just...|wavy|relax...~
LEVI!
Tch. A trap? How DARE you make a fool of me?|next,-5|Give up, Scarlet! You are cornered!|next,15|Hmph. You have no idea what I've faced before. Come and try me.|next|I'll suck your life energy to the husk...!
...|next,13|...I-It's over, Scarlet! You're coming with us...!|next,15|Curses... I lost. And now I have to flee like a coward...!
|anim,-5,WeakBattleIdle||anim,-4,Sad|No... No! He escaped!|next,-5|We must go after him!|next,13,WeakBattleIdle||anim,-5,Idle|Ngh... No, it's okay. We are all injured. Did quite the number on us...|next,-4,Flustered|So he just leaves scot free!?|next,14||anim,-4,Idle|Not...quite. We have seen his face and hideout, and lived to tell the tale.|next,13,Idle|Before, we could only track his patterns from the missions he posted |line|on the boards.|next|But now that we know what he looks like, we can set up wanted posters. He will not operate freely.|next,14|If he's smart. He'll probably leave Bugaria after this.|next,-6|We know it's a victory, but it's still a shame...|next,13,WeakBattleIdle|Y-Yeah. Ow... We're going to need a good rest...|next,14|Yeah... He didn't look strong at all, but I guess that's what makes him scariest...|next,-4|Well. Case closed, I guess.|anim,-4,Happy| Reward time?|minibubble,16,-5||next,-6|Nothing stops you, eh Vi?|next,14|...Could we discuss this a bit later? I want to get out of here.|next,13,Idle|Vi, your team saved my life. You will be rewarded.|next|But I agree with Celia, let us discuss payment back in town.|next,-4|Alright, alright. No rush~!|next,13|I had berries in mind, but... I believe I have something better, Vi.|next,-4|Really!?|next,13|I've heard you were barred entry from that |color,1|place|color,0|. I can get you back in again.|next,-5||destroyminibubble|The place?|next,-6||checkflag,8,20|That shady place behind the shop? Why do YOU have access?|next,-4|Woah, really!? Who cares, Leif? This is awesome!|next,13|I will go ahead and arrange for you to be able to get in.|next|Meet us there when you can.|next,14|We'll be behind the shop in the Ant City. See ya there!|next|...And thank you, Team Snakemouth.
|flag,8,true|Well, that was rough.|next,-5|Sigh... Vi... Couldn't you just help them for the sake of it?|next,-4,Angry|A job's a job! I'm not a charity.|next||anim,-4,Happy|Besides, I can't wait to show you two that place!|next,-6|Let's hope it's not the last place we visit...|next,-5|If anything, I'm just glad Scarlet's been foiled...|next,-4,Idle|All's well that ends well. Let's go meet up at the plaza!
Vi! Plea-
My Queen, |face,antq,ants|are you sure about this? These lands are very dangerous...|next,antq|If there was any other way, I assure you I would take it.|next,-5||face,ants,-1|The Forsaken Lands... Do the rumours hold true?|next,antq|Many dangerous beasts roam in the Forsaken Lands, some even disguise themselves in various forms.|next|Famished creatures, always waiting for their next meal in this land where plants only grow by miracles.|minibubble,@Eep!,-4||anim,-4,Sad||next|But heed me! Nothing in this land compares to the horror we will live |line|if the Wasps get the sapling.|next,-5||flip,ants|I've heard that Termites dislike Ants heavily. Would they open their doors?|next,antq|We can only hope they realize this matter concerns them as well.|next,-6|Having a Queen with us is not the worst insurance.|next,antq|Let's proceed at once. You are to keep me safe, but I will support you where I can.|next,-5|Leave it to us!|next,ants|Be careful out there, my Queen. The real horror would be a kingdom without you...|next,antq|My loyal subject, I thank you. Please wait faithfully for our return.
As long as Elizant is following the party, you are now able to use the |color,1|Royal Decree|color,0| skill in battle!
Please protect our Queen.
Hiding a secret or two, Vi?|next,-4,Idle|Maybe. It's a long story. It's this place in the Commercial Area...|next,-5|It sounds quite shady...|next,-4,Happy|Look, whatever. This is awesome! You'll see.|next,13|I will go ahead and arrange for you to be able to get in.|next|Meet us there when you can.|next,14|We'll be behind the shop in the Ant City. See ya there!|next|...And thank you, Team Snakemouth.
