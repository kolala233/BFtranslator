Good job everyone! That was a fierce battle.|next||checkmapflag,0,71||checktrue,166,71|If you want to retry any of your battles, just come back and check the B.O.S.S.!
Well, you can't always win, can you?|next|Maybe rearrange your Medals or train a bit more and try again later?
Oho! Good work!
We are ready!
Heal up first! (@EVENT@ left)
No, that's enough.
Alright then, here it comes!
Very well, a bit of healing coming up!|break||hide||heal||fwait,0.6||end|
I understand. Well, if you want to retry, just check out the B.O.S.S. at any time.
Hey there folks! Any questions about the B.O.S.S. program?|prompt,map,4,4,32,33,34,35,@B.O.S.S. program?,@How does it work?,@Do we get anything from it?,@We're good.|
Yes, what B.O.S.S. stands for is...|next|"Battery|line| Operated|line| Super|line| Simulator"!|next|With it, you can simulate old battles you have recorded in the crystals on your permit.|next|I still don't know how the crystal works, but just being able to read this data is fascinating!|next|In return for letting me test and study the crystals, you are free to |line|use the B.O.S.S. any time you want.|next|And should you do well in Rush Mode, I'll give you prizes! It's |line|a great deal!|next|Just check the computer over there to start it.
B.O.S.S. will read the crystals on your explorer permit and load data from strong foes you have faced in the past.|next|With that, you can refight old battles at any time you want!|next|The HoloMachine is not perfect, though. It flickers a bit way too much for my liking... But it works well enough.|next|You will keep items you had at the start of the run, so you won't lose any after the session.|next|But used items stay used in Rush Mode until you either finish it or quit, so watch out for that!
Yes! You will get some EXP from battles, but since those are simulations, the amount you get is very reduced.|next|But if you do well in Rush Mode, I can give you some Medals and goodies I have stored. Tempting, right?|next|Losing battles won't penalize you, so there is no risk involved as well.|next|It's a safe way to see how much you've grown!
Very well. If you want to try it out, check the computer over there.
So that's what the readings meant...|next,-5|Doctor, is Leif okay?|next,1|According to the tests, ancient crystal fragments lie within you. If |line|I'm not wrong, you can use magic?|next,-6|Yeah. After we woke up in Snakemouth, it just suddenly |line|came to us.|next,-4|So that wasn't a super bad lie?|next,-6||face,-6,-4|...You still doubted us?|next,-5|Given the weirdness of it, I'd tally it to healthy skepticism.|next,1||face,-6,1|Magical powers are a common side effect of a body being linked to these crystals.|next|Although there's still something our scanner couldn't identify. Something else may be inside your body.|next,-6|Something else?
There's so much data to sort through...It feels like I'll never finish!
But there's still |var,9| battle(s) left!|line|Are you ready?|string,3|

N-No. It's weird. We just moved on our own...|next|...Sorry. We don't know what happened. We're not too keen to be put under, however.|next,1,Idle|An involuntary self-defense mechanism...|next|Leif, was it? Give it some thought. Your condition is fascinating.|next,-4,Sad|I'm starting to get worried...|next,-6,Idle||face,-6,-4|Don't be. We feel fine.|next,-5,Idle|We're getting closer to the truth, although there's much left to answer...|next,1||face,-6,1|Well, I think we'll leave it at that for today. Sorry for distressing you.|next,-6|It's okay, really... Thanks.|next,-4,Angry|Welp... We're going to be late to the meeting, aren't we?|next,1|Ah, yes. The Ant Kingdom brought the materials for the key replacement, right?|next|I've heard there's |color,1|four other explorers|color,0| looking around the Hive.|next|Could you round them up in front of the throne room? I'll meet you there when I finish some things up.|next|Crow!
C-called me, doctor?|next,1|Round up the data! We have work to do.|next,3|Ah! Y-Yes, doctor!
Great... A walk around the Hive.|next,-6||face,-6,-4|Can't be the worst thing. We'd like to get to know this place.
Leif can now use |color,1|Bubble Shield Lite|color,0| in battle!
I still need some time to process the data, could you find the other explorers?|next|They should be around the Hive somewhere.
I will meet up with you soon, just head to the factory.
