What is this feeling? It's as if I was carrying many boulders...|next,-6|Yeah. It's some sort of violent aura.|next,-4|I'm fine. Aren't you guys overthinking it?|next|B-But it IS kinda creepy in here...
|shaky|Wait!
|tail,-5|Goddess Venus! What's the matter?|next,caller|...Listen, this is very important.|break||goto,4|
|tail,-4|Huh? A bud?|next,-6|Is that you, Goddess?|next,caller|Yup! Venus here. Listen, this is very important.|break||goto,4|
|tail,caller|I've been keeping track of your travels through my buds...|next|But this is my limit. I can't help you past here. You'll be on your own!|next,-6|We can feel some strong bloodlust coming from the area ahead...|next,caller|Yes... This is where the |color,1|Dead Lands|color,0| start.|next|Disgusting, heinous creatures roam that area where giants lived...|next|They are stronger than anything you will find in Bugaria. I can't fathom why they've never tried crossing over.|next,-5|The Roaches braved such horrors just to hide the Everlasting Sapling!?|next,-4|Makes sense, right? It's the ultimate challenge!|next,caller|This isn't a game, I'm serious!|next,-4,Flustered|We're serious too! This ain't just about treasure anymore!|next,-5||anim,-4,Sad|The Wasp King seems determined to go on ahead, beyond reason.|next|Even though it's dangerous, we can't risk him succeeding in his quest.|next,-6|Yeah. We can't let him roam around. For everyone's sake.|next,caller|Oh, please be careful. I've grown so fond of you all...|next|If you need any healing, just ask me. I really won't be able to help later.|next,-4,BattleIdle|Thanks! Alright team, we're going after that jerk!
I wish I could help you more, but my roots can only reach this far.|next|The Dead Landers are extremely powerful! Please flee if you must!
It's a shame the Sapling was destroyed, but maybe it's for the best.|next|What brings you here? The Wasp King's been defeated...don't mess with the Dead Landers!
