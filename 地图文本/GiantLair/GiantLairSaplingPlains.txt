|checktrue,555,29||tail,-6,WeakBattleIdle|...Hnnk...|next,-5|Leif! Are you ok?!|next,-6|There is... Some strong magic here.|next|We don't know what it is, we have never felt anything like that before...|next,-4|It's gotta be the sapling!|next,-5|Let's finish this!
|tail,elizant|Stop this instant! Your trail of violence ends here!|next,-4|Yeah! Our trail of beating you up comes next!
|tail,king|You're correct, pitiful Ant. Today, the fighting ends.|next|For when I consume this sapling...|next|You will have no choice but to squirm in fear and surrender to your|line|King!|next,-5|You think you'll rule with fear!? That you'll be happy that way!?|next,-6|Or that the people will so quickly submit?|next,king|Why, yes. I'm sure. Do you not see my crown?|next|No one cared about me, until I put it on.|next|Through power and magic, I became feared and respected!|next|From weakling to ruler... I had never been happier!|next,elizant|You're pathetic. You could never hope to be a true King!|next,king|You will all perish today. Your opinion holds no significance to me.|next,maki||boxstyle,1|I wouldn't be so sure of that!
|tail,maki|Parry this, you crook!
|tail,king||boxstyle,1||shaky|Grah!|shaky||next,-5|Incredible, Sir Maki!
|tail,king,Idle||boxstyle,1||shaky|ENOUGH! FIRE, TO ME!
|tail,-6|Ngh...huh?|next,king|...What?|next,-4|W-Woah, we're kinda alright!|next,-5|C-Could it be?
|tail,king|Hmph. I should have finished off Vanessa. To think she'd give you that...|next,-6|We hope you're ready for our counterattack, tyrant!|next,-4|I've been waiting all day!|next,-5|Everyone, for our comrades! |shaky|FOR BUGARIA!
|tail,-6|Give it up, you're outmatched.|next,-4|Not that tough without that fire, huh?
|tail,king|I...I didn't come THIS far...|next||boxstyle,1|To lose to |shaky|plebeians like you!
|tail,king|Impossible...|next,-4|It's...it's wilted!|next,-5|A-After all this...!|next,-6|It wasn't that Everlasting, huh.|next,king||boxstyle,1||shaky||music,Alert|I reject this outcome!|next|I REFUSE TO ACCEPT IT!
|tail,-4|Gross!|next,-6|Stop being pathetic. You've lost!|next,-5,BattleIdle|Come here, and atone for your crimes!
|tail,king||boxstyle,1||shaky|Hnng.....aaaAAAAAAAAAAH!!|next,-4||boxstyle,0|N-No way! That actually worked!?|next,king||boxstyle,1||size,1.5||halfline||noskip|GRAAAAAAAAH!!!
|tail,king|...Yes...|shaky|YES!|shaky||next|This power will suit me just fine!|next|I will deliver you to your |shaky|DOOM!|shaky|
|tail,king|................|next||shaky|N-no... It can't...|next|NO! I'M THE KING! I...I ORDER THIS BODY TO...
|tail,king|AAAAAAAAH!!
|tail,-4,Surprized|W-what happened?!|next,-5|What a pitiful end...|next,-6|His greed and cruelty led him to this.|next,-4,Idle|...We got super lucky...
|tail,zasp|...Is it over?|next,mothiva|...You really did it! Wow.|next,kina|Team Snakemouth...you've saved us all!|next,elizant|I truly thought we were doomed.
|tail,-4,Angry|...So he's like, a tree now?|next,elizant|Is this also an Everlasting Sapling?|next,-6|...No. There is no magic coming from him.|next|He truly is just a tree, as Vi said.|next,6|That's weird...why'd he transform?|next,elizant|The Everlasting Sapling's power was said to be infinite... Was that a myth as well?|next,7|There's nothing truly infinite, is there?|minibubble,@My beauty!,8||next,-4|He was so strong, though!|next,-6|Perhaps he was simply unable to control its power.|next|Maybe it was sealed for the safety of others...|next,-4,Sad|Can we think about it later, though? It's still dangerous here and stuff.|next,-5|Wait, Vi. What should we do with the tree?|next,maki,BattleIdle|Perhaps we should strike it down? Just in case?|next,elizant|...|next|Lower your blade, Maki.|next,maki,Idle|Your Highness?|next,elizant||music,Sad2|It will remain as a symbol of our long struggle. Of our journey for the sapling.|next|A warning to not seek its power any longer...|next,-4,Idle||flip,-4|Can't we put like, a cooler statue here or something?|next|Like a Team Snakemouth statue!|next,elizant|No.|minibubble,25,-4||next,-5||destroyminibubble||anim,-4,Idle|Heheheh. Vi, you've truly made this journey something else!|next,-6|You too, Kabbu. We wouldn't have it any other way.|next,mothiva||face,party,mothiva|You're not gonna get sappy in this dreadful dumpster, are you?|next,-5|W-Well, it's kind of emotional for me...|next,mothiva|Look, the Wasp King is gone, and we have |wavy|technically|wavy| found the Everlasting Sapling!|next|We should celebrate with a big show!|next,zasp,Angry|...Or at least rest.|next,elizant|...Hah! Well, it does sound good.|next|We've completed our mission, after all.|next|But first, let us inform the Roaches of what has occurred.
|tail,-6|...Elizant?|next,elizant||flip,elizant|Yes, Leif?|next,-6|Are you truly satisfied with this?|next|Your mother will remain sleeping forever...|next,Elizant|...|next|Everything I said in the village was true.|next|I...would not place that wish over my people's needs.|next|But no, I'm not satisfied. It was a sacrifice, after all. It was my duty.|next,-6|...Thank you. You've grown into a fine queen. And now we can say it for sure.|next,Elizant|Thank you too, Leif. I can tell you served my mother and I earnestly, despite your doubts.|next|Let's go. This is no place for us anymore.|next,-6|Lead the way, our Queen.
|tail,-5|Have...have we won!?|next,king||shaky|You... How DARE you...!!!|shaky||next,-6|You can't regenerate forever!|next,-4|Y-Yeah! Shut up and give up already!
|tail,king||shaky|I...I AM...ETERNAL...So what if you're STRONG?!|next|I...AM IMMORTAL...I...|next|I AM EVERLASTING!!!|next|I WILL TAKE EVERYTHING! IN THIS WORLD!|shaky||next,-5|Impossible! After such a long fight, you won't concede!?|next,-6|It won't end like this!
|tail,king||shaky|IT'S OVER, VERMIN!
|tail,king|THIS POWER! IS...|shaky|-GRUHH!?!?!
|tail,king||shaky|NO!|next|It... Itwasmeanttobe... INFINITE!
|anim,-4,Angry|Aw...
|event,true||align,right,true,2.5||tail,-5,instant|...Elder? Are you alright?|next,caller||flip,caller|Yes... I was merely pondering.|next|Even though it was supposed to be everlasting... The sapling still wilted.|next|Were our ancestors wrong then? Did they not manage to create an eternal plant?|next,-4|Umm... I mean, it is pretty dark here, and the sapling was stuffed inside that thingy.|next,-6|Mhm. We suppose the sapling still requires sunlight despite it being|line|undying otherwise.|next,caller|I see. That does make sense.|next|It makes me wonder, would the King then be unstoppable if you fought him in daylight?|next|He did burn through the sapling's power fast, and that in the end consumed him.|next|But would he have been truly unstoppable outside?|next,-5|All in all, we were lucky to have that happen.|next|If that was indeed a possibility, it is great that we managed to stop him when we could.|next,caller|Still... Did our ancestors really not consider that option?|next|...Sorry for keeping you around. There's so much to think about...|flag,596,true||break||event,false||end|
Our sacred sapling... Don't mind me, I just need to think...
|tail,-4,Angry|Still kinda bummed the sapling's gone. We worked really hard to find it!|next,-5||face,-5,-4|It may be for the best, Vi. An era of searching for great power has concluded.|next,-4,Idle||face,-4,-6|Uh huh... Hey |face,-6,-4|Leif, you sure there's no magic in the tree|minibubble,@Sigh.,-5| at all?|next,-6|We're sure. We felt some in the seed the King ate, but that's gone now.|next,-5|Come, let us leave this place. There's nothing left for anyone in this cursed land.|breakend|
|tail,-6|...The magic that we felt here once is now gone.|next,-5|So the sapling and the King are truly...|next,-4|...Come on, let's look around for a bit.
|tail,-6,BattleIdle|Crud.|next,-5,BattleIdle|We've got to stop him here! He must not grow more powerful!|next,-4,BattleIdle|Well, duh! We can't run away now!|next,-6|...Together, everyone! Let's finish this!
|tail,-4|Is the Elder like...the Roach Queen?|next,-6|Doesn't seem that way. Everyone just seems to respect her very much.|next,-5|A Queen chosen by the people... In the north, we also had such a system...
