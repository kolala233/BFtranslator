So high up...|shaky||next,-4|Look. If you fall, I'll catch you, okay? Just get moving!|next,-5,Idle||shaky|Vi...!|shaky| ...Very well. I won't give up. Let's go!
Going down to Defiant Root?|prompt,map,0.75,2,2,3,@Yes,@No|

Enjoy your visit to the Hive!
Do you have a tour scheduled? No civilians or tourists allowed otherwise.|anim,-4,Angry||minibubble,@Ugh.,-4||breakend|
The Hive's gigantic!|next,-4|Mhm. Most bugs just see the main area though. Most of it's just honey and housing.|next,-6|So most of this Hive is honey? We'll have to investigate...|next,-4,Flustered|That honey's for bees!
Ah, the Queen's allowed you in. Go on ahead.
It's relieving to get out, isn't it? And nobody got hurt!|next,-4|Mhm...|next,-6|Something on your mind?|next,-4|Kinda. Malbee and the Overseer never really approved of me... But |line|they changed their mind!|next|So, I dunno. Maybe I CAN fix stuff with my sister!|next,-5|Vi, you've mentioned her before, but what kind of bee is she?|next,-4|Her name's Jaune. She's a painter in the Hive! |anim,-4,Sad|We got into a really bad fight...|next,-6|The crisis is over. We won't complain about a small detour, |line|but it's up to you.|minibubble,@Indeed!,-5||next,-4,Idle|...Thanks. I'll think about it. I'll drop by when I feel it's right!

Calm down!|next,-6|A bridge's not the best place for sudden outbursts.|next,-4,Idle||anim,-5,WeakBattleIdle|Look. Everything in the Factory's super expensive! And they don't let you leave mid-tour!|next,-5,Idle|I see...We should shop beforehand, then?|next,-4|Yup! Let's save some berries!|next,-6|Or we could spend a little not to have to go all the way back...|flag,660,true|
