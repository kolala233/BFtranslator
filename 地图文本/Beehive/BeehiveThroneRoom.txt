This throne room is so pleasant, and the smell is fantastic!|next,-4|That's what a bunch of honey and flowers will do to any place, really.|next,-6|The Queen's demeanor also lightens up the mood. Shame we're here for business.|next,-4|Eh...I'm sure I can get you both back in.|next,-6|Oh? You're willing to come back?|next,-4|...Let's go!
You heard the Queen! Head to the factory! It is through the west exit.
My Queen, the Ant Kingdom's explorers have arrived. The doctor's |line|here, as well.|next,2|Oh! Adorable, aren't they? Welcome!
I hope the Hive has shown great hospitality and kindness towards you.|next,-5|Y-Yes! We are grateful, Que-|wait,0.75||blank||tail,7||face,party,7|Oh, most respected Queen! Your words humble our heart - we are truly blessed to be in your presence!|minibubble,5,6||fwait,2||minibubble,6,7||next,-4,Sad||destroyminibubble||face,party,2|Uh, yeah. It's nice to be back...|next,2||flip,2|Vi! Is that you? You have grown so beautifully into a fine bee!|next,-4|U-Um...|next,2|We have heard of your exploits here. You have brought pleasant surprises to my days.|next,-5|That's great, Vi!|next,-4|T-Thank you, Queen.|minibubble,7,7||next,5|The Hive is wonderful! Makes me wish I was a bee!|next,2|Ahaha! Now, now. We all have our wonderful place in this world.|minibubble,8,-6||next|But now, the time for pleasantries is over. If you don't mind,|line|let us get to the matter at hand.|next|H.B.?|next,8|Yes, my Queen.
As we all know, the graceful Ant Queen has made a heavy request of our kind.|next|The core of the Honey Factory, which we owe this great kingdom to, |line|has turned out to be an artifact.|next|Under normal circumstances, we would have to deny even the Queen her request.|next|However, she has provided us with all we need to build a new core.|next,4|R-Right! Kina should have delivered them to the factory already...|next,8,Angry|Fufufu... Yes, I have gone there and gave a quick examination.|next|With my incredible intellect, I can quickly create a suitable replacement. |line|All due to these materials' incredible quality!|next,2|It's quite a simple ordeal, isn't it? Almost feels like we've gone through |line|a bit too many formalities...|next,7||face,2,7||face,party,7|Never, Your Majesty! There is no request we would not acquiesce for |line|thee!|minibubble,@Ac-squeeze?,-4||next,2,Happy|Ahaha! If you are true of your word, that would make me most happy.|next|For I would like to invite you to accompany the doctor to the Honey|line|Factory, and witness this pivotal exchange.|next|You are not obligated to go, but it would warm our heart if you did...|next,7|Yes. YES!|next,5|Sure thing! We would love to see even more of the kingdom!|next,-6|Yes. For one, seeing honey being produced sounds delicious.|next,-5||face,-5,-6|Leif, you are not to eat any of it!|minibubble,@(Aww...),-6||next,-4||destroyminibubble|Um, thanks. We'll go.|next,2,Idle||face,2,-4|Vi...|next,-4||face,-4,2|Q-Queen?|next,2|Contrary to what I believed, it seems the outside world did you some good.|next|You look so grown up! Your team|line|has my thanks.|next,-5|Ah! Um, you're welcome, Queen.|next,-4|I...I haven't changed at all. I'm the same Vi!|next,2|Ahaha... A mother knows best. Maybe you've yet to notice.|minibubble,@...,-4||next,7|W-Well! Shall we go?|next,0|The Queen is speaking! Shut your mouth!|minibubble,@E-Eep!,7||next,2|No need to be so ruthless, my dear guard. Ahaha!|next|But you are indeed free to go unto the factory. It's to the |color,1|west|color,0| of my throne's entrance.|next|Vi, please take care of everyone as they explore. As sure as I am that there will be no issues.|next,-4|...Yeah. I will. |anim,-4,Idle|You can count on me!|next,0|Dismissed!|next,7||wavy|Sigh|wavy|...Let's go, Zasp.|next,6|About time.|next,8,Idle||face,party,8|Now, teams. I still have to pick up some tools. We'll meet up there.|next|Don't let the wind blow you off the bridge!
(Mothiva... Don't overdo it.)
(|shaky|Shut up!|shaky|)
(Grr!!!)
(This Queen is something else.|fwait,1.5||blank|If only ours |line|took note...)
Geez, Vi. You made bees seem so mean! When you have a graceful |line|Queen like that!|next,-6|Even we are disarmed by her words. They remind us of Elizant.|next,-4,Angry|...I was mad at everyone, okay?|next,-6|Even so, you shouldn't have badmouthed them.|next,-4,Flustered|Fine. I'm sorry, okay!? |anim,-4,Sad|And I'll, uh...I'll fix stuff. Slowly. Can we |line|just do the mission?|next,-5|Heheheh. Alright. Let's go, team.
Say, Vi. The Queen mentioned a mother knowing best...|next,-4|Just a bee thing, really.|next,-6|Do you think of the Queen as your mother?|next,-4|Not really... She's the Queen before anything else.|next,-5|I'm sure she does think of you as her daughter, though.|next,-4|Dunno... Everyone's her daughter to her. Does it make anyone special then?|next,-6|That's another way of thinking about it...|next,-4,Flustered|You two are overthinking this! Let's get going already!
|tail,9||face,10,9,true|Excuse me!? How could you let this happen!?|next,10|I-I don't know, my Queen...|next|Reports say that something went wrong at the |color,1|Power Plant|color,0|, which |line|caused the Code 32 lockdown!|next,9|And you found nothing in the Power Plant? Are you certain you |line|looked through EVERYTHING?|next,10|Y-yes, Your Majesty.|next,9|To think our honored guests were endangered! This must not happen again. Please do see to that.|next,10|We will continue our investigation with double the troops!|next,9|You should have given it your all from the start!|next,10|S-sorry, my Queen...|flag,225,true|
|checktrue,555,19|Ah, Vi. I humbly commend you for your service at the Factory.|next,-4|It was no problem!|next,caller|I hope that this incident doesn't make you dread coming home again...|next,-4|N-no. Seriously, it's super fine!|next,caller|Oh hoho! I'm glad, Vi. ...I hope you can reconcile with everyone soon.|next,-4|Y-yeah. I'm uh, working on it. Gotta go!
What could have happened at the Power Plant...?
A Code 32!? Were we under attack!?
I heard about the shutdown. I apologize in behalf of the Bee Kingdom! |line|This will never happen again!|next,-6|Um, no problem. What a passionate response...
The way to the factory is just outside, you can't miss it.|next|Please enjoy your visit!
D-Don't mess with the queen, okay? Or you'll answer to me!
|tail,-4|I don't remember her ever being so...uh, meek. Meek's the word.|next,-5|Something quite traumatic must've occurred.|next,-6|Well, she's still willing to keep going. That's worth respect.
Vi...I knew since you were born you'd do something incredible.|next|Your path may have been unconventional, but I am proud of you.|next,-4,Happy|M-Mom...! You helped us out too!
One Midge caused all of that? Well, I'll be...
Thank you! Thank you SO MUCH! We can never repay you!|next,-6|Um, no problem. What a passionate response...
