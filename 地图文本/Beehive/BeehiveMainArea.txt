If you head down this path, you will reach the Residential Zone and the Balcony.

|tail,-5|Goodness, what a grand welcome!|next,-6||face,-6,-4|Vi, is this normal?|next,-4,Sad||face,-4,-6|Uh, not really... @EVENT@Hold it, folks!
|face,-6,-4|The scanner picked up something weird from one of you...|next,-4,Sad|W-What?|next,-6|Was it us?|next,caller|Most definitely.|next,-5|Is Leif okay!?|next,caller|Dearie me. We've caused a scene. Could you come with me? I'll check |line|it out ASAP.|next,-4|You sure you wanna trust her, Leif? |next,-6|Yeah. We don't have any leads right now. Nothing to lose.|next,-5|Guide the way, doctor!
Oho! So dashing... Explorers are so interesting!
This ball is really cute, right? I look just like Mothiva!
Hmm...It's been so boring lately. I wish there was some gossip, at least.
My...I've always been a bit plain. But clothing works wonders, doesn't it? Hohoh!
Welcome, welcome! Mothiva's famous accessories are on sale! They'll bring the best out of you!|minibubble,@Doubtful.,-6||break||destroyminibubble||end|
The Queen is the epitome of grace and beauty! Please mind yourselves around her.
The Queen is the light that shines upon us all! Do mind yourselves around her.
Jaune's art is...beautiful. But is art meant only to be pretty? We should explore our inner hideousness...|next,-6|Good luck getting someone to buy THAT portrait...|next,-5|At least wait till she draws it before judging!
Heeeey! How're you liking our wonderful Hive? Have some honey,|line|it's on me!|next,-6|Thank you. We won't forget this.|minibubble,@S-So kind...!,-5||next,-4,Sad|Y-Yeah, thanks...|break||destroyminibubble||heal,tp||sound,Heal2||end|
|flip,caller,true|Just my luck. Team Snakemouth.|next,-4,Flustered|You've got some nerve walking into the Hive!|next,caller|Hmph. Pipe down. I'm here on explorer business, just like you.|next,-6|Come to steal some more credit, we assume?|next,caller|If you expect an apology, you won't get it.|next,-5|Ngh. So you're proud of your actions?|next,caller|I don't operate on pride. I'm commited to Mothiva's rise to the top.|next|We saw an opportunity and took it. It didn't work out, but it's not the end of the world.|next|As you can see, even without the artifact, she is still respected.|next,-4,Angry|Who's gonna respect someone so petty! Bet they wouldn't if they knew the truth!|next,-5|Vi! We're not going to start badmouthing others!|next,caller,Happy|It wouldn't matter. See if they'd believe some bumbling fools over |line|the great Mothiva.|next,-6|Hmph. Look, we don't care. Can you just move it to the meeting point?|next,caller,Angry|That, I can do. Business is business, after all. My interests are |line|not petty banter with you three.|next,-4|Yeah, yeah. Just go.
We'll notify Mothiva as well. You won't wait for long.|next,-5|See you there.
Mothiva must be waiting, anyways. See you there.
|tail,-4|Okay, that should be everyone. Let's go to the meeting!
|tail,-5|We still need to find the other explorers. Let's look around.
|wavy|Ohohoho!|wavy| Now now, there's enough Mothiva for all!
Mothiva!|line|Mothiva!
Ugh! How can she be so popular while being such a jerk!|next,-6|Ignorance is bliss for this crowd...|next,-5|Um, Mothiva?|next,caller|More fans? Ohoho-
What are |shaky|YOU|shaky| dorks doing here!?
Huh?
Mothiva?
Hm?
|wavy|Aww... 
|wavy|A-Ahahaha!|wavy| Sorry, show's over! I hope you'll join me in my next tour!
Thanks for ruining a perfectly good tour, jerks.|next,-4,Flustered|We didn't do anything! And you're the jerk!|next,caller|Your mere presence ruins my vibe, can't you tell!?|next,-6|Maybe you can steal some of ours when we're not looking.|next,caller|Why you...|next,-5|Enough! We're not here to fight you. We have a mission, can't we cooperate?|next|We need not hog the glory. If we work together, we will all be recognized!|next,caller||wavy|Sigh.|wavy| So naive. What good is fame when shared with the likes of you?|next,-5,Hurt|U-Urk...|next,-4,Angry|Look, just go to the darn meeting point. We can settle this later.|next,caller,Idle|Hmph. I'll go, but not by your barking. See if you don't keep me waiting too long.
And get Zasp to go too, okay? I can't be bothered after seeing you three.
What a jerk! I really really don't get how no one sees it!|next,-5,Idle|It's a shame her defeat didn't humble her one bit...|next,-6|We'll have to be careful, we never know what they'll be planning... 
|hide||event,86|
|tail,-4,Flustered|It's them!|next,-5|Let's get the meeting underway. Maybe they've even repented!|minibubble,@Doubt it.,-6||breakend|
My, these paintings are quite... unique.|next,-4|Artia really needs to add some color sometimes.|next,-6|We agree, but maybe she won't be happy if she does.|next,-5|Someone who's happy in a gray world... is that truly possible?|next,-4|You're really overthinking this... 
|face,-5,-6|(Psst! Leif!)|next,-6||face,-6,-5|(What? Why are you whispering?)|next,-5,Happy|(Don't tell Vi, but... Doesn't that little bee look like her?)|next,-6||anim,-5,Idle|(Ohhh... yeah. She does, doesn't she? She looks so annoyed, too.)|next,-4,Flustered|You suck at whispering!!!
Ah. Children are so pure!|next,-6||face,-6,-4|Vi is right here.|next,-4|Not in the mood.|next,-6|It's not funny if she won't react...|next,-5|Leif, you should take it easy on her while we're here.|next,-6|Fine... 
What a nice bee. It warms my heart!|next,-6|So tall. Cheerful, too.|next,-4|Even I can't get mad at Vilma...|next,-5|I feel bad, though. All that honey for free...|next,-6|Not us. We intend to keep eating.|next,-4,Angry|How are you two not fatter!?
|tail,-4,Happy|That scarf is so pretty!|next,-6|Mothiva's a crook, but her clothing brand is pretty high quality.|next,-4,Sad|Wait, what? Isn't it only those red balls?|next,-5|It seems any item she helped create has a small icon... Look at the scarf's corner!|next,-4|Ugh, that sucks... No way I'm going to buy it.|next,-6|You could just cover her logo up.|next,-4,Angry|Nuh uh! She ain't getting one berry from me!
|boxstyle,3||spd,0|Out For Lunch.
Hmm...|next,-4|What's up?|next,-5|It's nothing. I'm just thinking about clothing...|next,-6|Gonna buy some?|next,-5|No, no. I'm happy with how I look.|next|I'm not sure how to feel about others wishing to change their image...|next,-4|Bugs can do whatever they want. If they wanna wear a big hat they can do it!|next,-6|Can't say we oppose that view.|next,-5,WeakBattleIdle|You're right. It's not my place to judge others, even if I'm not going to wear clothing myself.|next,-4,Angry|Geez, it's not like you cut the scarf off of her. Stop apologizing! 
Let's gather everyone so we can get the meeting started!
|tail,26||face,25,-1||face,26,-1|Maybe I can sneak out and eat some more fountain honey before the meeting...|next,25|Seriously, Eri. Just stay still!
Why would you look for me now? Don't you know my time is berries?|next,-4,Flustered|Shut up, or we'll take even longer!
Despite everything...I must say, runt. The Hive is quite nice to be in.|next,-4,Flustered|It's nowhere someone like you should be in!
|tail,-5|It seems only Kina is left...|next,26||face,party,26|Oh, nah! She gave us the parts. So we're good to go.|next,25|She's shameless, that's what she is!|next,caller|Then, if these are all the explorers, we shall open the throne room.|next|Be on your best behavior, for even glancing upon our Queen is a privilege.|next,27||face,party,27|Oh, of course miss guard! We adore the Queen, and would never |line|dream to upset her! |wavy|Ohohoho|wavy|!|minibubble,@!?,-4||next,-6|Are you the same Mothiva...?

Prof. Honeycomb and Dr. H.B. are the last bees from the old generation.|next|They sure managed to outlive even some of the new generation. Is this the power of science?
...You'll take my request, Vi?|next,-4|Yup. Don't make a big deal out of it, ok?|next,caller|...Alright. I'm looking for the |shaky|blackest, darkest|shaky| of all paints.|next|I need it to complete my masterpiece. To challenge Jaune's reign |line|as the best artist of the Hive.|next|You sure you can handle that?|next,-4|...A job's a job. Where can I find it?|next,caller|Your soul is a dark grey... But anyways... I've heard it's with |line|someone in the Termite City.|next|He hates being around in the open, a lover of the darkness. So cool...|next,-6|Sounds like you two would get along pretty well.|next,caller|Don't speak nonsense...I simply admire him. I would meet him myself, were it not so far.|next|Get it done, Vi. The pay's good.|next,-4,Angry|Better be. It really IS far away...|flag,431,true|
Procure the |shaky|blackest|shaky| paint from the Termite City.|next|If you don't know where to start, search the darkest parts of the city...
...Found it yet, Vi?|next,-4|Yeah. He won't budge, though. Sorry...|next,caller|...Drat. I feared this would happen. Listen up...|next|My boyfriend lives in the Ant Kingdom.

Don't take too long. I must reveal my next piece before Jaune...

|shaky|GRRR!|shaky| What the heck! That's no way to treat family!|next,-6|Just what did you do to her?|next,-4,Angry|I told her she drew like a weevil.|next,-5|Vi! What in blazes! You can't just go around saying that sort of thing!|next,-6|We're assuming this is a new type of insult...|next,-4,Angry|Well, she called me stuff too! Weak, short, coward...|next|I couldn't talk about exploring without her talking down to me!|next,-5|Exploring is extremely dangerous.

She'd be too happy to get mad!|next|Maybe then we can have an actual conversation. |anim,-4,Angry|Hmph.|next,-5|Where could we start searching? I know little of paint.|next,-4|I dunno either, but uh... it's made in the Golden Settlement, right?|next|We could just take the tunnel and check it out when we're free.|next,-6|Then let's keep that in mind. Jaune seems to need it quite badly.|next,-4|Alright. Let's get a move on!
A-Are you okay?|next,-4|Yup. Let's go back in whenever!|next,-6|That's a relief... Let's meet your sister properly, then.
