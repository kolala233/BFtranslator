|checkpos,x,11,25|Astounding. We can see everything from here!|next,-4|Look, there's the pier!|next,-5|Oh, there's the Golden Hills! Can't see Venus, however.|next,-6|And there's Snakemouth. Wonder why we feel so drawn towards it... 
Only bees allowed past this point.|next,-6|Can you get us in then, Vi?|next,-4,Angry|Noooope.
We've found them! Let's make sure they get to the meeting.

Heeeey! Team Snakemouth!|next,3|Thanks again, we owe you for back in the desert...|next,-5,Happy|It was no problem. You would do the same for us.|next,-6|They would try, at least.|next,2|We'll make up for it, you'll see.|next,3|Mhm. Hey, Vi? You're being real quiet.|next,-4|Oh? Uh...sorry. Just thinking.|next,3|The Hive is SUPER cool! We have to come back together when we're not on the job!|next,2|Everyone's really nice. And they let us drink from the fountain for free!|next,-4|Y-Yeah... Glad you like it. You ready to meet up?|next,3,Surprized|Shoot! We forgot!|next,2|We'll see ya there, Team Snakemouth!
Well, at least they're having fun.|next,-4,Angry|Hmph.|next,-6||face,-6,-4||face,-5,-4|Vi.|next,-4||flip,-4|What? If it's about earlier, drop it. I don't want to talk about it.|next,-6|Look at us, Vi. This is serious.
You're mad over petty things. You're acting like a child.|next,-4,Flustered|Seriously? THAT'S what you wanted to tell me!?|next,-6|We're not finished.|next||anim,-4,Angry|Something may happen tomorrow, or even today. And then, you won't be able to say sorry.|minibubble,9,-5||anim,-4,Sad||next|Instead of acting so proud, won't you be happier if you fix things?|next,-4|...|next,-5||destroyminibubble|Vi, Leif is right! We never know what can happen. Friends are so precious to lose over nothing...|next,-4|...But what if she doesn't forgive me? I was really mean...|next,-5|If you really mean it, and show it, she'll forgive you. You're sisters!|next,-4||flip,-4|......|next||flip,-4||anim,-4,Flustered|F-Fine. I'll try.|next,-6|Hmm. You're more mature than we expected.|next,-4|Shut up!|next|We're on a mission now, |anim,-4,Sad|but...|next|W-When we have time, I'll try and apologize. Okay? |anim,-4,Angry|Are you happy now!?|next,-6|You promise?|next,-4|I'll do it! I don't need to promise it like some kid!|next,-5|Heheheh. Alright, Vi. We believe you.|next,-6|We hope it goes well. Life's too short to have dumb fights.|next,-4,Sad||wavy|Sigh|wavy|...I feel all tired now.
Let's go find the other explorers, okay?
Everyone should be at the throne room now so... Let's go, okay?|next,-5|Yup. Let's go, team.|next,-6|We'll be rooting for you, Vi.|next,-4,Idle|...Thanks.
Leif... 
|tail,-6|We've been thinking for a while... what are those things some bugs |line|wear on their eyes?|next,-4|You mean glasses?|next,-6|Never heard of them.|next,-5|They're this fascinating gadget that helps bugs with poor eyesight see better!|next,-6|Really? That small trinket improves eyesight?|next,-4,Happy|Really cool huh? They started being sold a while ago.|next,-6|It's good to see some things do get better with time. 
|tail,-6|Ah...we want to join another eating competition.|next,-5|The Golden Festival is the only one, though.|next,-6|That's impossible. Eating is the best. How can it be once a moon?|next,-4,Happy|Don't be such a glutton, Leif.|next,-5,Happy|Indeed. You must watch your figure!|next,-6,BattleIdle|Don't act like you don't sneak in Honey Drops mid-mission! We've |line|seen you!|anim,-4,WeakBattleIdle||anim,-5,WeakBattleIdle||minibubble,@S-Sorry...,-5||breakend|
|tail,-6|These two seem to be together a lot, don't they?|next,-5|Two friends traveling across Bugaria...not that unlikely, right?|next,-4|They should become an exploration team already!|next,-6|Shame. They don't seem like they can fight.
|tail,-6|Vi, can't you convince this guard to let us pass?|next,-4|Noooope.
Look, the Golden Settlement! Can't wait for next year's festival!
You can see where we used to stay! Good old times.
The Bee Kingdom was generous enough to let me conduct my research here. |next|The least I can do is lend others my "|color,1|Eliascope|color,0|"! Give it a go with |button,4|!
Leif, it's good to see you again. Your performance was very pleasing.|next|It would be great to have you at next year's festival.|next,-6|You can count on us.|anim,-5,Happy| 
|checktrue,228,29||tail,-4,Angry|It's her.|next,-5|Come on, Vi. Let's see what she has to say.
|align,left,true|Oh dear, what to do...|next,-4,Angry|Okay. I can do this. Huff...here I go!|minibubble,@Hang in there!,-5||next||anim,-4,Happy|...What's up? Can I help you?|next,caller||face,caller,-4|Dunno. Can you?|next,-6|Tell us your issue. We'll see.|next,caller||anim,-4,Idle|I thought buying a house in the Ant City would be great, but I didn't enjoy it at all.|next|I just get too homesick for the amazing Bee Kingdom...I dunno |line|what to do with it now.|next,-5|Homesick, huh. I understand how you feel.|next,-4|Uh, that sucks. C-Can we help?|next,caller|Are you interested in the house? It's right in the main plaza...|next,-6|You mean the red house near the inn? We could use a place...|next,caller|Yeah. How about 150 berries?|anim,-4,Flustered||minibubble,26,-4| It's cheaper than I got it for...|next,-6|Goodness. The housing market's gotten rough.|next,caller||anim,-4,Angry|Won't blame ya if you don't want it. It's nothing compared to here.|next,-4,Angry|We...will...think...about it.|next,-5,Happy|(We're proud of you, Vi!)|minibubble,@(Aye.),-6||next,-4,Sad|(Let's just go...)|flag,227,true||break||destroyminibubble||end|
So...? 150 berries for the house. You in?|showmoney||prompt,map,2.5,2,21,22,@Hand over the keys!,@That's too expensive!|
|checkmoney,150,22||money,-150|Hey... Thanks a ton. Here's the key.|break||giveitem,1,54,23|
150's the lowest I'm going to go. I've already lost money on it.
You really helped me out...I can fund my next project with this...|next,-4,Angry|It was nice helping you.|next,caller|If it gets off the ground, you three can come in for free... For real.|next,-4,Idle|Really?|next,caller|Yeah...I never forget a favor. Take care, okay?|anim,-5,Happy||next,-6|Mhm. It's good to not be homeless anymore.|next,-4,Happy|Yeah! See you around!|flag,228,true|
Mmm... Maybe I should try buying a house in Defiant Root.
|tail,-6|So all the Bees live here?|next,-4|Yup. And it's super duper off limits!|next,-5|First the ants, now the bees...I cannot help but feel excluded.|next,-4|It's just how stuff is. Sorry!
|shaky|150?!|shaky|
|align,left,true||face,caller,-1|Hey again. The Bee Kingdom's quite fantastic.|next,-4|Uh...you think?|next,caller|The air is clean, and the people are nice. There's a great view and good food.|next,-6|Think you'll stay here?|next,caller|...No, I don't think I will. I want to see what else the world can offer.|next,-5|May we meet again, explorer!|next,caller|May we meet again, indeed.|flag,599,true|
May we meet again, indeed.
|tail,-4|...She gave us a really good deal, huh.|next||anim,-4,Sad|And I've only said bad stuff about her...|next,-6|...Well, at least she didn't hear you.|next,-5|And you helped her in the end! You've made up for it!|next,-4,Idle|...Yeah. I'll watch the stuff I say a bit more now...
