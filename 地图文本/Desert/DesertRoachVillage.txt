|tail,-6|This smells like Snakemouth Ruins.|next,-4|Couldn't the Roaches have lived in a normal place? Like the Ant Kingdom!
|tail,-6|This statue seems eerily familiar. A Roach?|next,caller|Oh, it's you.|next|That's correct. It's most likely a statue of the Roach village founder.|next,-5|That's right! We saw some Roach ruins in Snakemouth too.|next,caller|What!?|next,-4|Yeah. It was all around where we found the artifact!|next,caller|Incredible. This is information you should've shared right away.|next|I guess that explains why this key was here...|next,-6|That key, could it be for the Sand Castle?|next,caller|Don't ask me. But Roaches and artifacts often pop up together.|next|Just what made them disappear? This is what I want to know.|next|All the damage you see is simply a result of the passage of time. A few sandstorms here and there roughed up the place, but...|next|With the Oasis so close by, I find little reason this place would be abandoned. Most curious...|next,-4|Uh huh. Hey, you wouldn't mind giving that to us, right? We really |line|need it!|next,caller|You're asking me to hand you over a priceless historical relic?|next,-5|P-Please? We'll return it...|next,caller|...Well, sure. If it really leads to the artifact, it'll give my research a boost.|break||giveitem,1,105,2|
|tail,-6,instant|Thanks, Hawk.|next,caller|Do get back to me with any developments.|next||checkflag,343,5|I'll head back to Professor Honeycomb's lab to compile my findings.|next|If you ever drop by, please share what you found with the key with me.|next,-5|Will do. Safe travels, Hawk.

|tail,-4|Hey, it's Hawk!|next,-6|Let's see what he's up to. Maybe he's got a lead on the keys.
I'll head back to Professor Honeycomb's lab when I'm done |line|with another desert errand.|next|Stay safe. Maybe I'll see you around.|next,-5|I'm sure we will. Safe travels, Hawk.
