And so, we arrive.|minibubble,2,3||next,-4|Hey, Kabbu. You're from the north, right?|next,-6|We do recall hearing it once or twice.|next,1|You had many tales of this land when we first met. Would you serve as our guide?|next,-5|...Yes. To be sincere, I've been waiting to return to this wretched place.|next,-4,Sad|Uh, what? Wretched?|next,-6|You've been acting weird. What's going on?|next,-5|I have only bad memories of this border. Listen, and listen well.|next|These are the Far Grasslands. They connect the Lost Sands with the Wasp Kingdom.|next|Given the state of affairs, it is likely their walls are sealed. Even if we walk north to them...|next,-6|We wouldn't be able to get in.|next,-4,Angry|How did you get here, then?|next,2|There's obviously some off-path or something...|next,-5||anim,-4,Sad|That is correct. East of here...is...the |color,1|Wild Swamplands|color,0|.|next|Hideous monsters, wild tribes, thick water at every turn...|next||anim,-5,WeakBattleIdle|It's...very dangerous.|next,1|Kabbu, I had no idea it was this dreadful...|next|I'll take your words to heart, Kabbu. It's clear this is not a |line|journey we can underestimate.|next||flip,2|Kina, you should stay behind with Yin.|next,2|What? Are you crazy? You know how strong we are together!|next,1|I cannot risk this young bug suffering a harsh fate.|next|Please, I beg you to watch her until I return.|next,2,Angry||shaky|Grrr!|shaky| You always do this! You always run off without me!|next,-5|Kina... Please, try to understand your brother!|next,2,Sad|I'll watch Yin. But I do it for you, brother. Not for her!|minibubble,2,3||next|If you don't come back...|anim,2,Angry||shaky|I'll beat you up!
|wavy|Muh muh!
...|wavy|Sigh|wavy|. Not an easy day for anybody.|next,-6|We aren't at the swamp yet, but we cannot relax.|next,-4,Idle|Yeah. It's east of here, right? I'll make sure there's no traps around!|next,-5,Idle|This area changes constantly, so I can't tell what's ahead.|next,-5|Stay close to me. Let's go!|next|(Forgive me, team. If I told you my plans, you'd...)
I still can't believe we got to be part of Maki's team, even if briefly!|next,-6|You're such a fanboy.|next,-4,Happy|He's the one who should be honored! We're the super best |line|Bugarian team!
Far Grasslands...|next,-6|Heavy folliage here.|next,-4|This is part of the Wasp Kingdom, they probably don't care much about cleaning stuff up.|next,-5|Lots of wild creatures live here, we need to be extra careful.|next|(...Still...)
