I understand. Come back when you are ready.
So what's the big plan?|next,3|Yin brought me here once. I believe it's where she was born.|next|She may have been waiting to come back to mature...|next,-6|Is there any basis for that?|next,caller|...Well, no. But trust me on this one.|next,-5|That we will. But why did you require our assistance?|next,-4|Yeah. You made it here all by your-|fwait,0.2||anim,-4,BattleIdle|Aw crud!|next,3,BattleIdle|For I suspected this might happen!
You could've told us before!|next,4|Maki, explaining his plans? Please...|next,3|Not now, Kina!|next,-6|They were probably attracted by the energy Yin's giving off.|next,3|Don't let them get near Yin! We must protect her until she pupates!|next,-5|Team, let us stop them!
Oof. Seems we managed to ward them off.

Brother needs some real challengers!|next,3||anim,-4,Idle||anim,-5,Idle|If you're interested...you know where to find us.|next,-6|Uh, not really. You're always moving around...|next,3|...The Ant Palace's bridge.|next,-5|W-We'll think about it!|next,2|By...by-bye!
|tail,-6|We'd always felt some magic here, but...|next,-4|Didn't expect it to be cuz of Yin, right?|minibubble,@Mhm.,-6||next,-5|I do wonder where Yin's parents went, though...?|breakend|
