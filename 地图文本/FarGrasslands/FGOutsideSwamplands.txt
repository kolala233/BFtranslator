The path ahead is one of the structural weaknesses into the |line|walls I spoke of.|next|Because this area is covered by heavy foliage, it seems the Wasps haven't noticed this crack yet.|next,-6|Well, good for us. Let's go in then.|next,caller|Don't be hasty. You mustn't let the Wasps catch you.|next|If you're captured... That's it. It's over.|next,-4|Can't be any tougher than the bandit hideout.|next,caller|Do not underestimate the Wasps, Vi.|next,-5|Indeed, we must be utmostly cautious.|next,-6||wavy|Yeah, Vi.|wavy| You better not do ANY underestimating.|next,-4,Angry|I get it!

Huff...If only I could express how glad I am to be out of there.|next,-4|No surprise, we can do anything!|next,8|It's not much of a celebration, but we get to set up camp and rest for a few moments.|next,-6|Would it be wise to stop now?|next,8|Of course. We've all taken quite a beating. My leg most of all...|next|If you're going to infiltrate their kingdom, you'd best be in top shape. |line|Give me a moment.
