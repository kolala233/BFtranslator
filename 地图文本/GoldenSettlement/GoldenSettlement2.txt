The harvest this festival has been amazing. Thank you so much, Venus!
|tail,-4|It must be rough picking up berries all day...|next,-6|Ants are extremely strong, are we right?|next,-5|Indeed.

Great job! Even a half-wit like you can use the Halt, it seems.|anim,-4,Angry||minibubble,@Hey!,-4||next,caller|Another tip for you.
