You better beat him, Leif!|line|We'll show him embarassing!|next,-5|(Can't we just get along...)
You met Venus, didn't you? She sent me a request to keep the Golden Hills entrance open for you.|next|You must've done very well to receive her approval.
|checkflag,132,160|Hmm...|next,-4|What's up, Kabbu?|next,-5|I may have been too quick to judge them...|next,-6|You're still on about that?|next,-5|Just because they aren't what I see in an explorer doesn't invalidate their work...|next,-6|If you feel that bad, just go apologize again.|next,-5,Angry|Very well. I will face my sins!|minibubble,@He did it!,-4||next||destroyminibubble||end|
Hey! Team Snakemouth!
We will stick around until the festival ends, then we will head |line|out for the Lost Sands.|next|See you there!
We did come to the settlement a while ago to gather info on the artifact.|next|All we know, though, is that it rests on top of the hills. No one besides Aria and a few selects ever made it there, from what we gathered.|next|If you perform the special ceremony with Aria, you will be granted access. That's the only chance to get the artifact.|next|Maybe this year's lucky bugs will be you?

Hey! You're Team Snakemouth, aren't you?|next,-4,Happy|That's us!|next,58|Nice! We're fellow explorers too. Ever heard of us?|next,-5|Given what I've heard... Are you Stratos and Delilah?|next,58||anim,-4,Idle|Yep, that's us! I'm Delilah, and this big guy's Stratos.|minibubble,@Mhm. Nice meeting ya.,57||next,-5|You're known as "Team Slacker", correct? Famous for never finishing missions?|minibubble,@Not even one?,-6||next,57|No mission's interesting for long enough. Why bother finishing them?|next,-5,Angry|And you still call yourselves explorers?|next,58|Of course! We love exploring! No place's outta reach!|anim,-4,Happy||minibubble,@Nice.,-4||next,57|We're more like informants, ye? For the other explorers.|next,58|We gather intelligence about tough quests so other teams can do them. |line|Nice deal, ain't it?|anim,-5,Idle||next|We're looking into the fabled |color,1|Sand Castle|color,0| in the corners of the |line|Lost Sands!|next,57|After the festival, we'll resume our search. This'll be a good time to unwind.|next,-6|Looks like "slacker" ain't quite the name for them.|minibubble,192,-4||next,-5|So that's how things were...|next,58|Let's meet again on the road, yeah? Maybe we'll meet at the desert!|minibubble,@Mhm.,57||next||destroyminibubble||end|
That gigantic beetle, and a mosquito. Hmm... Could it be...|next,-6|Your friends, Kabbu?|next,-5|Not quite.|next,-4|We should say hi. They look really strong!
Ugh... We drank too much juice last night, so we couldn't get moving.|next,48|We couldn't even watch the last ceremony...but we heard you made|line|it into the hills!|next,47|I assume you've found the artifact?|next,-4|That's right!
I'm so jealous! That's two important artifacts you snagged from everyone |line|else!|next,47|Great job! We should head back to the Ant Kingdom at once! The Queen will be very pleased.
Heheh! We're doing great!|next,-5|Come now Vi, let's go to the Ant Kingdom.|next,47|We will go on ahead to notify the Queen and prepare an audience.|next|If you don't want to walk all the way back, you should go through the |color,1|Ant Tunnels|color,0|.|next|There should be one just outside the settlement.|next,48|Don't leave the Queen waiting!
Kabbu and Vi
Kabbu and Leif
You came. I'm very grateful.|next,-5|It was our pleasure, Acolyte. You look well... What seems to be the issue?|next,caller|I'll be brief, to not waste your time. I'm planning on giving the Goddess an incredible offering.|next,-4|An offering? Like a LOT of berries?|next,-6|Goddesses don't need money. Bet it's a bunch of food.|next,caller|That is correct.|next,-6|It is?|minibubble,@Seriously?,-4||next,caller|I wish to give Her a banquet worthy of one as great as She is.|next|I have prepared several dishes, that I have. But I'm missing...something grand. |next,-5|What sort of dish are you looking for?|next,caller|It's hard to say. Something I cannot simply buy would be excellent...|next,-6|We could ask Fry, Kut or Crisbee to make something. Their specialty, perhaps?|next,caller|I've heard the chef Fry has been planning his "masterpiece".|next|The Goddess would be overjoyed to taste something that divine!|next,-4|So uh... You think she'll give us something for it?|next,caller|Of course. Venus is generous, kind and loving. If you make her happy, she will reward you.|next,-5|Fry's masterpiece... We'll do our best to get it for you, Aria. |next,caller|You have my thanks, Team Snakemouth. I'll be waiting here for you.|next,-6|Let's make sure to make one for us too, Kabbu.|flag,185,true|
Did you bring it?|pickitem,0,0,true,false,182,181|
|checktrue,195,169|Ah. You're the ones that took the request, right?|next|I need a |color,1|Tangy Berry|color,0| to cook my newest idea.|next|However, they are really rare. It's rumored that only |color,1|Golden Seedlings|color,0| |line|carry them.|next|If you ever find one, bring it back to me. And I will cook you my greatest dish!|flag,195,true|
You're back. Did you find a |color,1|Tangy Berry|color,0|? Or are you here to cook?|goto,170,keep|

Give one ingredient.
Give two ingredients.
Not interested.

(That incident?)
Vi?
|tail,-5|We don't have it yet...|next,caller|Please bring it whenever you find it.
|checkvar,0,32,183|...|next,-4|Uh...|next,caller|This isn't grand enough for Venus.|next,-6|Sorry, we'll get back on it.
|removeitem,0,32|...|next,-5|...So?|next,caller|...Yes. I can tell that this dish is something worthy of giving to Venus.|next,-4|Nice! So we just have to deliver it to her, right?|next,caller|Indeed. We must venture to the top of the hills and deliver it to Her.|next|You go on ahead, I shall catch up in a bit.|next,-5|Alright. See you at the top.|flag,393,true|
Please go on ahead, I will catch up with you in a bit. Venus awaits at the top of the hills.
Thank you for that, Venus really enjoyed that gift.
Wow, the moon shines with a splendid light! Is this because of Venus?|next|I've seen so many wonderful things on this journey, haven't I, Nero?
|goto,-159|
Wo-Wow! That bee's such a looker...!
This fellow lives in the Ant Kingdom, does he not?|next,-6|Dunno. Sweet hat, though.
It's a battle!?|halt|
|tail,-6|What a warm glow.|next,-5|I've never seen anything like this! Could she be one of the 10 sorcerers?|next,-4|Nah. She's a firefly! I heard some bugs in other regions glow in the dark and stuff.|next,-6|Ice magic sucks. We want to glow in the dark.|next,-5|For the sake of our missions, please keep the ice magic...
They're living |line|the dream!
