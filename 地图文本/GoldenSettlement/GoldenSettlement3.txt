Phew. It sure was a day of hard work. Couldn't move the rock...|next||anim,caller,Happy|But tomorrow is a new day, and I will try again!

As the new priestess, I shall spread the goodwill of Venus to all.|next|I hope one day, I feel deserving of having met her.
Some Chompers waltzed on down from the hills recently. I threw some Numbnail Darts at 'em, but they didn't |line|do nothing!|next,-6|No problem. Who needs sedatives when you've got ice?
|tail,-4|All moths look so different from each other...|next,-5|Indeed. Leif, using your wings as a robe is quite unique!|next,-6|Well, Father did it all the time. We ended up copying him.|next,-5|I see. Your father must have looked very cool too!|next,-4|You could start a fad!|next,-6|Eh. It'd be no fun if everyone did it.
What a fascinating, adorable creature!

My card master hint is: |line|"Taking shade, always cool."|next,-4|That could mean anything!|next,caller|You'll figure it out, I'm sure!|next,-5|Still, thank you. We are closer to the tournament goal.|next,caller|By the way, Leif, if you ever want to play again, just drop the word, eh?|next,-6|Hopefully soon. But for now, we'll be on our way.
The card's filled up! You're ready for the tournament!|next,-4,Happy|About time!|next,caller|Show the full card to the old sailor at the pier, he'll give you the tournament fare!|next,-6|We'll do our best.
