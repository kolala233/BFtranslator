This city's all dull!|next,-5|Some bugs are born in such a place, and don't get to see the lush Bugarian Outskirts...|next,-6|Most Termites don't like sunlight, we hear.

Ahead is the Royal Chamber, mind your manners in there.|next|We won't hesitate in throwing you out the door.
Normally outsiders aren't allowed in the Royal Chamber.|next|You have come with the Ant Queen, so you're an exception.|next|Still, behave yourselves in front of the Queen and King!
Down this path is the Colosseum and the pier, feel free to visit them.
Behave yourself while inside the city!|next|If you want to leave just go through this gate here.

Team Snakemouth, your job is complete. Thank you for your service.|next|I hope you'll meet me at the table for the negotiations.|next,-4|See you there, Lisa!|next,15|...Yes, see you there.
Did you really just call the Ant Queen "Lisa"?|next,-5|It's too informal!|next,-4|You two gotta learn to relax! Let's look around and catch up!

Do you want to take on that request?|prompt,yesno,33,34|
Excellent. I shall add it to your pending quests.
Your call, but you should take on that request.
...TermaNet?|next,-4|No clue.|next,-6|Seems to be a technology unique to this land. For communication.|next,-4|We should tell H.B. about it!|next,-5|(I...I don't get how it works.)
S-Sir! Please, sit down for a bit!|next,-4|He's super ignoring you.|next,-6|Overworking's global, huh.|next,-5|You can't work if you collapse! Sir, please listen to |wavy|meeeee!|wavy||next,-4|Kabbu's nagging's global too...
I lost a bet and ended up having to wear this. I've really grown to like it, though!
Tch. I'm tired of DineMite, but cooking's such a drag...
They don't have DineMite in your town? Wow, how do you EAT!?
The Termite Kingdom's quite impressive, but all this store food |line|makes me miss Fry's cooking.|next,-6|Machines can't really match Kut's expertise.|next,-4|Or Crisbee's baking! Um, guess we know where to go after the mission.
|tail,-4|Is it uh, healthy to just eat one food?|next,-6|Delicious as it may be, we reckon it's not.|next,-5|We don't even know what's in it...!

Come again, for an explosive dining!
That ain't enough. Sorry, but the discounted burger ended last week.
You wanted takeaway with no space? Come DineMite later?
H-hey. You took my request...didn't you...?!|next,-5|Indeed. What seems to be troubling you?|next,caller|I haven't been able to sleep well for a while...

I must...|next,-6|Look, maybe we can deal with your sleep issues first. Any clues on what it can be?|next,caller|...Y-yes. I have heard that if you mix something that can cause sleep with flour, it can make a special recipe that allows anyone to sleep well!|next|I love sweets, so maybe you can get one of those for me?|next,-5|It is worth a try. We will come back if we find anything.|flag,625,true|
H-hey! Did you bake the sweets?|pickitem,0,51,50|
G-geez... Did you forget what it was? It was some sleeping thing with flour...

Come on... I need to sleep or I will go crazy! But I can't just sleep like this!

Hopefully my work performance will increase! If not, at least the sweets were nice...
These lands have a unique fruit. The Termites call it a "Squash". |next|They are harvested from the Plumplings that roam around the wilds.|next|Cooking it by itself is already good, but mixing it up with Flour makes something really great.|next|What if one mixed a Squash with some defense boosting ingredient?|next|My appetite flares up just thinking about it...
