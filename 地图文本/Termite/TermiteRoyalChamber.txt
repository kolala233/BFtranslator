|tail,-6|Now this is a better mood.|next,-5|My eyes appreciate the light! But I do wonder...did their throne have to be in the last floor?|next,-4|Well, duh. It's the throne. Come on, Kabbu!
...|next,-6|Um, Queen?|next,caller||flip,caller|Team Snakemouth.|next,-4|You gonna go in?|next,caller|......|next|I'm a bit nervous.|next,-6|It's not often a Queen's the one requesting an audience.|next,caller|If only it was just that. I cannot help but think that if I fail, we are all doomed.|next,-5|Queen, y-|wait,1||end|
So the report was true... To think someone like you would come here.|next,guard2|Our royals will now grace you. Don't pull anything funny.|next,elizant|...Let's go.
|wavy|Oh my lovely|wavy|, the guards just handed me a most jolly report!|next,queen|Is that so? What is it, dear?|next,king|They said a visitor that will surprise us has arrived! They should be here soon!
Oh, my dear! It really is...|next,king|...|next|........ 
YOU!!!
How |shaky|DARE|shaky| you walk into my hall, and break the moons long separation of our people?!|next,elizant||boxstyle,0|Your eminences...|next,king||boxstyle,1|That is |shaky|KING|shaky| Hector IV and Queen Layra II for you, Ant!|next,elizant||boxstyle,0|My apologies, King Hector. Queen Layra.|next,king||boxstyle,1||shaky|HECTOR IV|shaky|! Not |shaky|HECTOR|shaky|!|minibubble,@...,elizant||next,queen||boxstyle,0|Dear, watch yourself. You'll faint from disgust.|next,king,Upset|...What is your business!?
I won't mince words nor play around the issue. The Ant Kingdom has been raided by the Wasps.|next|My people have been hurt, and the artifacts of old have been taken...|next,queen|The artifacts? So you did find them after so much struggle...|next,king|And then you incompetently lost them!|next,elizant|...Indeed. The Wasp King holds power I had never witnessed.|next|Even my loyal knights, Vi, Kabbu and Leif, had a hard time with the Wasp King.|next,-4|Nice to meet you!|next,-5|I-It is my honor.|minibubble,@Sup.,-6||next,king|Hmph, threw away that Maki of yours?|next,elizant|He was injured in the attack. It would have not been prudent for him to come.|next,queen|Such a varied team... It seems just about anyone can get into Bugaria nowadays.|next,-4,Angry|What's that supposed to mean?|next,-6|Vi, you've gotta shut it this once.|minibubble,@Hmph.,-4||next,king|What's it to us, then? You ruled poorly, and got your trinkets stolen.|next,queen|You presume we should worry? As if our great defenses would be felled by some Wasps.|next|This dome of ours has survived storms without a single scratch.
What?
You truly think so? That the Wasp King, who's found the magic of flame...|next|And will soon obtain the full power of the Everlasting Sapling, shall be of no threat to you?|next,queen|F-Flame, you say?|next,king|That sapling is a darn myth, that drove your mother insane!|next|Oh, how many more moons we could have had with her, if she hadn't been so obsessed!|next,elizant||boxstyle,1|It is |shaky|NOT|shaky| a myth!|next,king,Angry|Watch your tone, Ant!|next,elizant|We found the mask, the tablet and the key. Or were those myths as well?!|next|The King is heading towards the Giant's Lair, an area none dare to|line|tread!|next|He would lead a crazed army towards such a place based on simple hearsay? Open your eyes!|anim,king,Upset||minibubble,@...,king||minibubble,@...,Queen||next|You think I would travel the wasteland personally, and bear |line|brunt to your crass tone...|next|If all of Bugaria wasn't facing great peril? You think of me so pathetically!?|next|I accepted and respected our treaty, after our negotiations turned sour.|next|I am not asking you to change your mind in that regard...|next|But if you care for your people, you won't turn a blind eye to the danger heading our way!?|next,king||boxstyle,0|Grr...|next,queen|Dear, calm yourself. You're being blinded by the past.|next,king,Angry||face,king,Queen|You can't truly mean she's swayed you!|next,queen|Ants are unrefined in many ways... They cannot match our intellect|line|either.|next|But they do not yield under pressure, and work very hard. |line|It is nature's way.|next|I know you speak the truth, Queen Elizant II.|next,king|Layra, you were always too soft!|next,queen|And you too stubborn. That's why I am by your side.|next,king,Upset|......|next||face,king,elizant|...What would you ask of us?|next,elizant|Although it would be for the best for our nations to try and reconcile...|next|Right now, what we need is a way to head towards the Giant's Lair.|next,-6|A way to cross the sea.|next,queen|Dear, weren't the scientists...|next,king||face,king,Queen|You mean |wavy|that|wavy|? You'd TRUST them with |wavy|that|wavy|?!|next,Queen,Idle|Oh, it's missing just a few touches. It'd be a fun test ride.|minibubble,10,king||next,elizant||face,king,elizant|Will you help us, then, in protecting Bugaria?|next,king,Upset||destroyminibubble|I'm not convinced!|minibubble,@Dear...,Queen||next,king|You say your knights lost to that puny Wasp? You think our soldiers wouldn't match up?|next|I wish for proof of the enemy's strength.|next,-6|We do not think you'd wish for their visit upon your kingdom...|next,king||wavy|That|wavy| still needs some time to be completed.|next|Before then, I would have you participate in our ancient tradition.|next,queen||destroyminibubble|Ah... The |color,1|Colosseum|color,0|!|next,-5|You'd have us fight for sport?|next,-4,Idle|That's my type of diplomacy!|minibubble,@Vi...,-5||next,king|If your people best our brave warriors, then we might be in a real|line|pickle.|next|Your knights will face off in glorious combat, and then I shall decide!|next,elizant|You won't let me join them?|next,queen|I would like for you and I to discuss some other matters as the fight goes on...if you don't mind.|next,-5||face,elizant,-5|Leave it to us, my Queen! We'll do well!|next,-6|Mhm. They'll see we're not joking around.|next,-4,Happy|It's been a while since a public smackdown!|next,king||face,elizant,king|You will find the Colosseum around the residential district of our kingdom.|next|Do not dally. Your kingdom is against the clock, after all.|next,queen|We'll start the ceremony shortly after you arrive.|next|I hope you can provide a good show!
|wavy|*grumble*
My apologies, Team Snakemouth. But I will be counting on you.|next|Do not fail!|next,-5|You can count on us, your majesty!|next,-4,Happy|Let's go to the Colosseum!
...Don't dwadle! The Colosseum is at the residential area, you can't miss it!
We hope you provide a great entertaining show for us!
I shall discuss some matters with Queen Layra. I'm counting on you!
|tail,-4|She really shut that king up!|next,-5|Her words had me nervous...I'm glad we've been given a chance.|next,-6|She's no Elizant, but...we're warming up to Lisa a bit.
|tail,-4|The Queen is um...big.|next,-5|That is not a matter we should discuss here. It's very sensitive!|next,-6|They both seemed to have met the previous Queen. So they must be very old as well.|next|Or Termites just live longer, who knows...|next,-5|That's the beauty of our people. We're the same, but so unique!
|tail,-4|He's sure packing a lot of anger for a short guy!|next,-6|Really? YOU'd make short jokes? At a KING?|next,-4,Angry|I never get to! I've gotta take the chance!|next,-5|Just uh, make sure he doesn't sic the guards on you... 
Team Snakemouth. I've heard of your exploits. You bring honor to our kingdom!|next,-6|Oh yes. That's what we're here for.
|wavy|Grumble...|wavy||next,queen|Oh sweetie. You've got to get over it.|next,king||wavy|GRUMBLE...|wavy||next,queen|I'll start, then.|next|We acknowledge your plight. The Termite Kingdom stands much to lose |line|over this issue.|next|Our finest engineers have been working on a prototype vehicle.|next|It is able to operate and travel under the water. It should be just what you need.|next,king,Idle|We call it the Subaquatic Maritime Neotransport! |line|We're very proud of it.|next,queen|Ehm, I like to call it Submarine for short.|next,king,Angry||face,king,Queen||wavy|Subaquatic Maritime Neotransport!|wavy| Layra, you are undermining me!|next,elizant||anim,king,Idle||face,king,elizant|I thank both of you from the bottom of my heart. Our people will be able to fight back now.|next,-4,Sad|Um, so it goes under the water? W-What if it breaks?|next,king|It is impossible for it to sink! It is our most advanced machine!|next,-5|...Err, yes. But what if it does?
It shall not. On my name! Please don't think with such cynicism.|next,-6|Alright then. Very reassuring.|next,king||flip,elizant,true||wavy|Sigh|wavy|. It's stationed at the pier, in the rightmost part of the city.|next,queen|Our head of research should be there to explain how it functions.|next,elizant|Excellent. We shall draw it to the Outskirt Pier, to make sure everything |line|is in order.|next,queen|...And, Queen Elizant.|next,elizant|Yes?|next,queen|If you'll have them, please let some of our people travel with you. They are eager to see your land.|next,-5|...! You will cease the separation?|next,queen||minibubble,21,king|Only for now. A small step. We'll purchase a bit of land, see how |line|things go...|next,elizant|Queen Layra, King Hector IV...|destroyminibubble||minibubble,@Finally...,king|I...I am very grateful. For everything. We are in your eternal debt.|next,king||destroyminibubble|You better repay it when the time comes! Or else!|next,-6|She will. Our Queen is honest and honorable.|next,elizant|Thank you, Leif. To have earned your backing is most pleasing.|next,king|Please, go and make haste.|next|...And protect Bugaria. Don't make me regret any of this.|next,queen|We're counting on you, after all.
I can't handle this... 
I shall go ahead and check on the submarine. Please meet me at the pier whenever you are ready.
Be careful with the Subaquatic Maritime Neotransport! It is the only prototype we have.|next|But I doubt some Wasps can even scratch it!
The submarine is at the pier. Feel free to board it at any time!
Ah...how did you like the Subaquatic Maritime Neotransport?|next|Pretty neat, if I do say so myself!
Good luck on your exploring!
Watch yourselves in front of our Royals!
You better behave...or I will bite your heads right off!
Hey! It's rare that we get outsiders here!|next|...Wait, you're with the Ants?|next|...Oh, look at the time! I must go...
We are the Queen's caretakers!|next|It's...a heavy task.
I'm watching you... 
|tail,-6|That's a |wavy|weeeeeird|wavy| statue.|next,-5|I cannot decipher what the artist wished to convey...!|minibubble,@Whatever.,-4||discovery,24||breakend|
|tail,-6|How adorable. The Queen's got lovely servants.|next,-5|I've seen the things they can carry! It betrays their small body!|next,-4|Woah. I've GOT to see that!
Hrmph. I...I...|next|Thank you...for helping us.
We're most grateful for everything you did.|next|Please, do feel at home in our Kingdom!
