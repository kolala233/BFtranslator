The Power Plant is inside the Bee Kingdom's tree, correct?|next,-6|It feels like one more room in the Honey Factory.|next,-4|In a way, it kinda is!
Drat! The Code 32 alert locked the door and I can't remember how to open it!|next|It's got something to do with all these switches... Think you can figure it out?
Ah! The door opened! We'll go in after you, okay?
Door's locked. Guess we're stuck here until a technician opens it.
Thanks Vi, though Code 32 means hostile forces...|next|G-go on ahead. We'll catch up with you later.
|tail,-4|Huh. This hole wasn't supposed to be here.|next,-5|Maybe it is what caused the alarm?|next,-6|...We should prepare before we go ahead.
Vi?! You're the one helping us...?
Ugh. It seems problems never stop popping up for us to fix!
|tail,-5|Vi, what is this machine?|next,-4|That's the Energy Converter! It uh...converts all the energy!|next,-6|That's a very helpful description, Vi.|next,-5|It must use the power generated from the windmill to power the Factory's core!|next,-4|Uh...yep! That's what the Power Plant does!|next,-5|It's no wonder many Bees visit the Golden Settlement for the Festival.|next|The winds here play a big part in creating delicious honey!|next,-4|Guess it's why the Bee Kingdom asked Elizant for control of this place.|next,-6|Elizant...Everyone won because she didn't cling to her territory.|next,-4|Bees won the most, cuz we get to make so much honey!|discovery,23||flag,458,true|

A giant Midge?! How did it get in there!?
If a Midge can stop the factory, anything can. We need to build a better system.
Well, Vi, I guess I was wrong about you. Sorry for doubting you.
|tail,-4|The Power Plant's way cooler than the factory. |anim,-4,Angry|How come I never got any shifts here!?|next,-6|Those Bees seem to be operating very complex machines. Do you know how to?|next,-4,Sad|I, uh, I'm sure I'd press the right buttons...|next,-5|Thankfully for everyone, exploring's your one true calling!
