So these are the Forsaken Lands...|next,-4,Flustered|I can't see anything! Where are we even going?!|next,-6|There should be some clues to the way forward, let's keep an eye on our surroundings.
Wo-hoh! Are these normal bugs I see?|next,1000|Patton! So this is where you crawled to after your exile...|next,-4|Who's this guy?|next,caller|Oh, just a little scientist.|next,1000|A MAD scientist, with no concept of ethics or safety regulations!|next,caller|Oi oi, my stuff never hurt nobody...too badly.|next,1000|...I do not have time for a trip down memory lane.|next,caller|You all seem pretty uh, buzzed out. Must be real serious.|next,-5|We must travel to the Termite Kingdom, or all of Bugaria will be|line|doomed!|minibubble,2,1000||next,caller|Boy, that sounds rough. It wouldn't help my research at all either.|next,-6|If you've got any tips, it'd help. This is some thick fog...|next,caller|Nothing to be done about that, but...|next|This land's full of trash yeah? Bugs've been |color,1|marking|color,0| it to remember the correct path.|next|So long as there's not a forked road, if you keep your eyes open you should be fine.|next,1000||destroyminibubble|Patton... Thank you for your assistance.|next,caller|Now, about that there exile...|next,1000|We will discuss that when the kingdom is safe. Please keep your...|line|trinkets here for now.|next,caller|Hehehehe. Alright. Drop by if you ever want a peek at 'em!

As long as you stick to the |color,1|marked|color,0| paths you should reach the Termite Kingdom...|next|Just keep your eyes open! It is that simple.|next|And, uh, come visit later? Without the Queen?
|align,left,true||face,caller,-1||flag,581,true|Welcome back, friends! Did you manage to find your way?|next,-5|Indeed. Thanks for your help.|next,caller|Hehe. I see the Ant Queen is no longer with you... So I suppose you could be interested in my services then?|next,-6|We are unsure. This seems really shady.|next,caller|My friend, you are wrong there. All I do is honest work!|next|My services can |color,1|change your stats|color,0| around.|next|Picked a wrong bonus during Ranking Up? I can fix that for you.|next|For a price, of course. |wavy|Hehehe...|wavy||next,-4,Angry|I don't like this... But I GUESS it could be useful.|next,caller|I have two operations here, |color,1|Stat Conversion|color,0| and |color,1|Potion Conversion|color,0|.|next|With Stat Conversion, I can extract all your level up and stat bonuses and convert them into potions!|next|What you do with the potions then is up to you. But that's where my second service comes in, the Potion Conversion.|next|With that, I can change a potion type into another. That way you can change the bonus you would receive.|next,-5|Uh, what do you mean by "extract"?|next,caller|Oh hoho! I assure you it won't hurt |size,0.5|much|size,1| my friend!|next|Give it some thought, alright? You know where to find me.|next,-5,WeakBattleIdle|...I have a bad feeling about this.
