So persistent.|next,-6|You're still injured, so let us handle this first.|next,-4|Yeah! We'll knock 'em out in record time!|next,caller|Stay cautious, Team Snakemouth.

W-WHAT'S THAT!?|shaky||next,-6|Kabbu! Is this...!?|next,-5|YOU! You MONSTER! How many must you terrorize to sate your infernal urges!?|next,-6|We've never seen anything like this...Kabbu, we should fall back!|next,-5|No! This beast...this beast ate my friends!|next|...You vile, wretched scum. You will rue the day you let me live!|next,-6|Kabbu, we get you're angry! But this is too risky!|next,-5|We've beat way stronger foes! We will destroy it!|next,-4,BattleIdle|K-Kabbu...|next|E-Eep! It's too late to run!|next,-5,BattleIdle|Come, you degenerate beast!

|shaky|Huff... Huff...|shaky|Thought I was done for...|next|T-Thanks, Kabbu...|next,-6|That was too close for comfort.|next,-5,Idle|... 
|anim,-4,Sad|You actually did it...I was extremely worried.|next||anim,caller,Angry|Kabbu, what is wrong with you!? You endangered your team! AND the mission!|next,-5|...I...
If I had been stronger back then, if I hadn't ran, could I have saved them? My friends...|next,-5|Vi, Leif... I'm sorry. I...I was blinded by this pain.|next,-5,WeakBattleIdle|B-Because of me, you almost...!|next,-4,Flustered|You better be sorry! I'm too young to get eaten!|next,-4,Sad|B-But I think I woulda done the same if someone, um, hurt you guys...|next,-6|U-Um, same. Even so, Kabbu...|next|We cannot turn back time. Even though they're gone, we're sure they're |line|proud of how much you've grown.|next|You saved us, after all.|next,-5,WeakBattleIdle|My teacher...would be scolding me like you are, Maki. For being such a fool!|next,1,Idle|...I'll take that apology.|next,-5,Idle|...Thank you, everyone. I don't deserve this kindness.|next,-4,Happy|Shut up! You're the kindest bug around!|next,-6|To a fault, we must say.|next,-5,Happy|E-Everyone...|next,caller||face,-4,caller||wavy|*Sigh*|wavy| That being said, we're at the Wasp Kingdom's door.|next|Because of my injury, I won't be able to accompany you inside, but...|next|I shall move on ahead and set up a camp so we may rest up.|next|I shall watch the exit route to make sure you can return.|next,-5|We can do this mission...together. Let's go, and fulfill our duty!
(Everyone, I hope you'll keep watching over us.)|next||anim,-5,WeakBattleIdle|(...If only I could have saved you. Curses...)|next|(Are you really proud of me? I can only pray it is true.)|next|(My friends...I won't ever forget our time together. Rest in peace.)
Maki is quite formidable. I do wish he could still fight alongside us...|next,-4,BattleIdle|Let's show him we've grown since our fight!|next,-6|(Kinda sad we missed it...)
|tail,-5|Master, Bit...I really did it. I found the Everlasting Sapling...|next|Even though it's only because of your sacrifice...|next|...|next|My new friends cannot replace you. But...|next|They're good. I wish you could've met them.|next|Bit, you would've thought Leif was so cool!|next|Master, you would've scolded Vi so much!|next|Those meetings that cannot happen...I will keep them in my heart.|next|...I'll come back to visit. Rest easy, now.
|tail,-5|Thank you both for waiting!|next||anim,-5,Happy|This is a big weight off my chest!|next,-4,Idle|...No problem.|next,-6|Let's go. Even with that Beast gone, it's no place to lounge around.|next,-5,Idle|Yeah...|flip,-5|Until next time.
