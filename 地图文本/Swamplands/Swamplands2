They're vicious alright.|next,-5|This area is their territory. We must try and get through without confronting them.|next,1000|It's truly a shame they do not understand us.|next,-4,Angry|Well, at least they're not super tough.|next,-6|Let's go then. Worst case, we freeze them over.|next,-5|(Maybe with Leif's help, I can...)
I wonder how the tribe is doing...|next,-6|You're too nice. They attacked us, you're aware?|next,-5|They were just protecting their home!|next,-4|Well, yeah. But we weren't hitting them or anything...|next,-6|If we walk around enough, we're bound to meet them again. Then you can ask.|next,-5|I feel that won't go well, sadly...
