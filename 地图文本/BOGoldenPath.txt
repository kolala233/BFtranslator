|shaky|Blast it all... We underestimated them...!|next,3|We must report this at once! Count your blessings, explorers!|line|You won't be so lucky next time!
Thank you. It would have been a steep fight without your help.|next||gettail,3|Think nothing of it. Explorers must support each other.|next,5|What a scare... Thank you all so much!

I'm not that famous!|next,-5||face,-5,-4|Neo and I met in the Lost Sands while I...travelled to the Ant Kingdom. |line|He helped me find my way.|next,5,Idle|It was nothing, compared to saving me from that ambush!|next|Coincidentally, I was examining this tunnel, linking the outskirts to the |color,1|Golden Path|color,0|.|next||anim,5,Sad|I never expected to get assaulted! Although a less visited path does |line|lend itself to it.|next||gettail,49|From what I overheard, they seem to be looking for artifacts as well?|next||gettail,3|I'll have to make sure to report that upon our return...|next,5,Sad|The wasps have behaved for a few moons, but they can't be planning anything good.|next|If it's going to be this unsafe, maybe I should cancel this trip|line|and head back...|next||gettail,49|Professor,|flip,5,false| we're on a journey to the Golden Hills.

We're going to need a good rest.|next,-4,Idle||flip,-4|After we figure out where we are...|next,-6|If we recall, this is close to the Ant Kingdom. We should get back to the city pretty quickly.|next,-6||face,-5,-6||face,-4,-6|...It's nice to feel the sun again. It'll be good to go back.|next,-5|Honestly, Vi may be raving about the artifact. But saving you is the true victory in my eyes.|next,-6|Um, thanks?|next,-4|Geez, calm down over there! Let's report to the Queen and get our reward!|next,-6|(Elizant...)
We should head to the Ant Kingdom.
