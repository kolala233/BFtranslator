What a cozy place...It's quite secluded from everywhere else.|next,-4|They should build a bridge here! Then they could build houses and stuff.|next,-6,BattleIdle|How dare you. And ruin this beauty!?
Someone, here? I must be seeing things...|next,-5|Our apologies for disturbing you!|next|We're, err, simply looking around.|next,caller|I thought I'd finally...I was finally alone. But even here society follows?|next,-4|We're leaving, okay? Sheesh.|next,-6|Try to have a nice day.|next,caller|...
Wait! That permit... You're explorers!|next,-6|Who else would detour into this cave?|next,caller|...|next||align,right,true|...You help people, right?|next,-4|Well, Kabbu does.|next,-5|What can we do for you, sir hermit?|next,caller|My name's Elom. I can feel...that you have something extraordinary. Something I miss.|next|But I can't put it into words.|next,-6|Probably a healthy side of optimism.|next,-4|YOU'RE an optimist?|next,caller|It's not that. I can feel you've been somewhere beautiful. Removed from|line|others...|next|I know what I miss is there. Can't you try and find it?|next,-5|Err, we usually get less vague requests...|next,-4|And we go to super awesome places all the time!|next,caller|When I look at the three of you, it's as if the |color,1|light of a Golden Paradise|color,0| fills my eyes.|next|Does that...help at all?|minibubble,@(No.),-4||next,-6|It's better than nothing.|next,-5|It's a tough request, but we'll keep you posted!|next,caller|...Thank you. I will keep trying to figure out my role in this world.|next,-6|Hmm...A spiritual Golden Paradise...|breakend|

Here goes...Um, hermit dude! Is this what you were looking for?
A bug? My request led you to another bug?|next,-6|In hindsight, probably not what a hermit wants...|next,1000|Hello, I've heard of your quest. That you've been here for so long...|next,caller|And? You will try to make me see the bright side, like all the others?|next,1000|Oh, not at all. I think this place is lovely.|next|If it's kept you entertained, it must be full of hidden wonders!|next|Would you mind if I stayed and looked around?|next,caller|...!|next,1000|...If that's okay.
You look at this world in a wholly different way, don't you?|next|You're not searching for the meaning in things.|next,1000|I think things happen just because. I love to admire the results!|next,caller|...|next|I would like you to stay.|next,1000|Call me Tekci. It'll be my pleasure!|next,caller||flip,1000|Explorers...|next,-5|Y-Yes?|next,caller|Thank you. I never expected you to go this far for me...|next,-4|Uh, me neither. Did we just play match makers!?|next,-6|As long as everyone's happy...|next,caller|This is the one worldly thing I have left.
It is from my younger days...I'm glad I kept it. If only to give it to you.|next,1000|I must thank you too, although I have nothing to give...|next,-6|Don't worry about it. We'll leave you to your introspection, and stuff.|next,-5|If you ever need us, just post in the town's quest board!
|tail,3||face,3,-1||face,1,-1|Elom's been here so long, but there's a flower he never noticed!|next,1|Tekci's got such a good eye for the small things in this world...It's really refreshing.|next|I'm blessed you made us meet.
|checktrue,578,12||tail,-4|I wonder what's the point in doing nothing all day...|next,-6|He could just feel tired, or something.|next,-5|Leif, this goes quite beyond simple fatigue!
This quest did not end as I expected...|next,-6|Eh, they're both happy. It works out.|next,-4|The client's always right!
