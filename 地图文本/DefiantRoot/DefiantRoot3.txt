Ah! My baby! My handmade, extremely high-quality silk!|next,-6|It did feel incredible carrying it back here.|next,-5|Miss Kali, did you truly create such an exquisite texture?|next,caller|That's right. Silks and the wondrous items of fashion and leisure it can be woven into are my absolute |shaky|PASSION|shaky|.|next,-4|They've gotta be worth a fortune! No wonder it got stolen.|next,caller|A fortune? Hah! You cannot put a price on a masterpiece.|next|...Though I'll have you know my prices are very economical, darlings.
This place is so cool though. I've never seen this big wheel before!|next,caller||shaky|W-Wait!|shaky| Do be VERY careful near that vase, my dear. It's a gift from a client very close to me.|next,-5||face,party,caller|Incredible. Your work touches the hearts of the wearer that strongly!|next,-6|Shame we're not too much into fashion...|next,caller|I'm itching to get back to work, so...|next|Please, let me reward you for all you've done for this shop.
And you all seem absolutely exhausted, you poor things. Breathe this|line|in, my darlings, it should soothe and fix your wounds with ease.|next,-5|Oh! Thank you so much!

I can't believe it! My baby! My handmade, extremely high-quality silk!|next,-6|That's gotta be Kali. Excuse us, miss?|next,caller|Whatever could you want? Can't you see I'm devastated?|next,-4|We're here to help!|next,-5|You need not suffer any longer. Could you tell us what happened?|next,caller|Aah...Explorers! Please excuse me, I've been very on edge.|next|I have ample reason to believe bandits have stolen my silk!|next|Not any silk, yes? This one costs both time and many berries to manufacture!|next,-6|The bandits've really done a number on Defiant Root.|next,-5|Leave it to us! You will be able to craft again soon!|next,caller|So dashing! Please, return it before they ruin it!|next,-4,Happy|You got it. Start getting that reward ready!|flag,472,true|

I'm sure they're responsible!|next,-5|Wouldn't one sooner blame the bandits?|next,caller|As if those uncultured criminals would know the value of MY CLAW!|next|Heck, if it wasn't the Wasps, they hired the bandits to do it!|next,-6|That's not much of a clue, is it?|next,caller|Look. It's gotta be in their kingdom, or the |color,1|Far Grasslands|color,0|.|next|If anyone can find it, it's explorers, right!?|next,-5|Worry not. We shall recover YOUR CLAW!|flag,635,true|
