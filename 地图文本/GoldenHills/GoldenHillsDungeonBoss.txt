The artifact is here. Somewhere.|next,-4|You sure? I mean, it's just flowers all around us.|next,-5|Flowers... That's it! One of these flowers must be the artifact!|next,-6,Idle|Uh, probably not.|next,-4|Only one way to find out! |line||flip,-4|Start cutting, Kabbu!|minibubble,@W-What!?,-5|
That's enough!
By the gods!|minibubble,@A Goddess...!,-6| It's Venus! It's Venus herself!|minibubble,@W-whoa!,-4||next,caller,0||wavy|Hee hee hee!|wavy| Indeed. The one and only.|next|I've been keeping my ear on you, with my precious buds...|next|I was really, really hoping all the bridges and monsters would stop you.|next|So stubborn! And now, you'd even trample upon my garden!? My precious garden!?|next,-4,Sad|I-It was just|flip,-4| a joke, okay? We just need the |flip,-4|artifact!|next,caller|To line your pockets, hmph! You cared more for an artifact than |line|your...blue friend there.|next|Washed up from a river, yet you worried more about a material thing |line|than your own companion!|next,-4|W-What? How did you...|next,caller|My roots travel all across the soil. Sometimes, I catch some gossip.|next,-5|I-Incredible! This is truly the feat of a higher being!|next,caller||wavy|Heehehe!|wavy| Though I must say, Kabbu. I am beyond pleased |line|with your worship!|minibubble,4,-5||next|You're so chivalrous, and kind. So why won't you share your burdens |line|with your friends?|minibubble,@Huh?,-6||next,-5,WeakBattleIdle|Venus, please! Say no more...|next,-4|What's your deal!? Is nagging people a Goddess' job?|next,-6|You know everything, then? What bothers Vi, Kabbu and us.|next,caller|Well, not everything. But I certainly know more than you lot.|next,-6,WeakBattleIdle|T-Then what about us? |anim,-5,Idle|Why are we still here, after so many years?|destroyminibubble||minibubble,18,-5||minibubble,@...,-4||next,caller|...You, you're all way different than your average bug.|next|Greed, sadness, purpose... Such diverse motives within your team!|minibubble,@...,-5||next,-6|Please, tell us!
P-Please, I am not worthy!
Vi! Kabbu! Leif! The artifact, and all the questions you want to ask...|next|If you get through my special trial, they are yours!

Ouch... Bugs nowadays have become quite strong... 
It is our honor to hear so, Venus.|next,-6|Now, if you'd answer us...|next,-4|And hand over the artifact!|next,caller,Idle|Fine, fine. I really owe you, anyways. Other than Aria, it's been years since I saw another bug!|anim,caller,Happy| It's been so refreshing!|next,-6|Hm? Were your roots not all across Bugaria?|next,caller,Idle|Well, my buds don't really have eyes. I can only sense things with them, you see?|next,-6|So you didn't see what happened to us in Snakemouth Den?|next,caller|Tell me more, you curious thing.|next,-6|Back when Elizant the First ruled, our team was on a scouting mission to Snakemouth...|next|We fell under, and a spider trapped us. We went asleep and woke up. When Vi and Kabbu saved us. So many moons later...|next,caller|That was quite a while back. Let me try and remember.|next|......|next|Yes, a team of three. One of them falls, the other two flee with their lives.|next,-6,WeakBattleIdle|They lived!|minibubble,@Thank goodness!,-5||next,caller|The remaining one lingers, |line|yet the presence vanishes.|next,-4|What, it just vanishes?|next,caller|Mhm. I don't recall feeling that presence since.|next|Even now, I cannot sense Leif's presence. Although I see you here. |line|I'm sorry, but that's all I can tell |line|you.|next,-6, Idle|Venus, thank you. Knowing our team was safe brought us much peace.|next,caller,Happy||wavy|Hee he he!|wavy| Ain't a Goddess for nothing!|next,-5||face,-5,-6||face,-4,-6|We are ever closer to the truth, Leif.|next,-4,Happy|Yup! Awesome!|next,caller,Idle||face,party,caller|No questions from you, Kabbu?|next,-5|Thank you Venus. But don't worry. I am managing quite well...|next,-4|If anyone's fine on the team, it's Kabbu!|minibubble,@Hm?,-6||next,caller|I'll respect your wishes on this.|next,-4,Happy|Anyways, that just leaves...|next,caller,Idle||face,-4,caller||face,-5,caller||face,-6,caller|I know, I know.

You have found the|line||color,1|  Ancient Tablet|color,0|!
Team Snakemouth ventured into the Golden Settlement, in search of another hidden artifact and answers about Leif's slumber.|next|After a festival of joy, friendship and bonding, the path to the sacred hills opened for them.|next|Filled with determination, they gathered the pieces to reach its highest point, and fought off Zasp and Mothiva along the way.|next|Now that they've earned the Goddess' approval and artifact, could the way to the Everlasting Sapling finally be within reach...!?|next||spd,0||fadeletter||center||line|End of Chapter 2.|fwait,2|
|tail,-4||anim,-4,Happy|Mission super complete!|next,-6|We should go report back, then.|next,caller|That tablet is important to find the Everlasting Sapling that the Queen's |line|searching for.|next|I do not know how it works, but it should hold clues on how to locate it.|next,-5|Thank you, Venus. How can we ever repay you?|next,caller|Hmm... Just promise to visit me sometime, alright? Bring Aria if |line|you can! |wavy|Hee he he!|wavy||next|Oh, and don't tell others of me, of course...

|checktrue,555,29|Goddess Venus is so nice for someone of her status!|next,-6|No kidding... Elizant II could learn a bit from her.|next,-4|Maybe we should bring the Queen to visit!|next,-5|That will probably be difficult, I imagine.|next,-6|And we're not willing to put in the extra effort to make it happen.|minibubble,@Aww...,-4||anim,-4,Sad||next||destroyminibubble||end|

What is it?|next,-6|You've heard the Everlasting Sapling had wilted, yes?|next,caller|It was the talk of every town! To be honest, I was quite shocked as well...|next,-6|We only reached the Sapling thanks to the Ancient Tablet you |line|entrusted us with...|next|How DID you get that tablet?|next,-4|Woah. That's right!|next,-5|Goddess Venus! Surely you didn't just stumble upon it!?|next,caller|...Oh, alright. I guess it's fine to say.|next|It was a very hurt Roach, who stumbled upon my garden. |next|Long before the Golden Settlement reached its prime...|next|He begged me to hide it from those filled with greed...|next|I wasn't able to save him, but I kept my Goddess word!|next|Although rumors spread, I never let anyone have it...until you three.|next,-4,Sad|Huh. I wonder what happened to him...|next,-5|And you considered us worthy of that Roach's trust?|next,caller|Ehee hee hee! You passed my trial, you know? Even if I was holding back...|next,-6|Thanks for being honest... It doesn't really matter anymore, with the Sapling gone.|next|But we were quite curious.|next,caller|It's a long chapter that's finally come to an end...|next|I wonder what will be the next great legend Bugaria chases!
