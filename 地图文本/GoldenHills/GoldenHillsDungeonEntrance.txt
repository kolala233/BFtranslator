|tail,-4|...I feel weird.|next,-6|No kidding. Even the air feels strange.|next,-5|This is not sacred land in name alone. There must be forces at play we can't see.|next,-4|We won't let it stop us, though!
|wavy|Heehee!|wavy| Visitors?
How nice of the two of you to come here.|next,-5|Goodness!|next,-4|Eeep! That plant can talk!|next,-6|...It can't count, though.|next,9|Huh? So there's three of you?
I see. Hm. So that's how it is.|next|So what brings you here? Come to take in the sights?|next,-4|We're here for the artifact! Fame and riches!|next,9|Hmph! Such reckless greed! How impure!|minibubble,18,-4||anim,-4,Angry||next,-5||destroyminibubble|Dear plant, we assure you there is more at play than mere riches...|next,9|Yeah right, you bugs always say the same!|next,-6|Nice going, Vi.|next,9|If you want to get the artifact, you'll have to get to the |color,1|top|color,0|...|next|Let's see if some flytraps don't eat you before then!|line||wavy|Ehee hee hee!
|tail,-5|Vi, announcing openly you are here to take treasure wasn't very smart.|next,-4|I mean, I wasn't gonna lie or anything!|next,-6|We're sure that's the reason.|next,-4,Idle|Whatever! You heard it. Treasure's at the top, so let's get climbing!|next,-6|Let's be careful. Something feels off about this place.
|wavy|Ohohoho!|wavy||wait,0.3| Aren't you hard workers?
|tail,-6|Uh, who're you?|next,8|Excuse me!?|next,-4|It's Mothiva! From the festival concert! Wow!|next,-5|It's an honor to meet such a famous individual!|next,8|Hmph. That's better.|next,-6|And she came with her personal stalker.|next,7,Angry|I am not a stalker.|next,8|I couldn't resist sneaking in! Seeing you work has been so inspiring!|next,-4,Happy|Heheh. Thanks!|next,8|Now, you wouldn't mind just letting us go after the artifact? |line||wavy|Pretty please?|wavy||next,-4,Angry|WHAT!? No way!? We put in all the effort!|next,8|Aw, come on? I'll even mention you in my next show! You'll get so much exposure!|next,-6|Hmph. Think of all the exposure we'll get turning in the artifact.|next,7|I wouldn't recommend getting sassy.|next,8,Angry|Tch. What do you even need the artifact for!?|next|While I was busy bringing joy to Bugaria's citizens, you snuck into |line|Snakemouth!|next|And now everyone's just talking about you!|next,-4,Flustered|That's not our problem! I ain't giving up that reward!|next,-6|The summit may hold answers for us. So we're not going to budge.|next,-5|I don't really care about fame, or riches. So I would let you pass, but...|minibubble,10,-4||next|It matters to my friends. So my answer is no!|next,7,BattleIdle|Hmph. So you've chosen to do this the hard way. Get ready.|next,-5,Angry||anim,-6,BattleIdle||anim,-4,BattleIdle|You would attack a fellow exploration team!?|next,8,Idle|Ohohoho! It's a bug eat bug world, on the way to stardom! We'll just put you to sleep for a bit!|minibubble,@This is stupid...,-6||next,-4|Have it your way! You're gonna get smacked down!|next||destroyminibubble||end|
Ugh... How could you!?
|tail,7|Tsk, they're strong.|next,8,Angry|How DARE you sully my fluff, you talentless, disgusting peasants!?|next,-4|That's what you get for trying to hijack our mission!|next,-5|Mothiva, you are nowhere near as kind as I hoped you would be.|next,-6|Mhm. And Zasp? You lost the little respect we had for you.|next,8|Silence! I won't forget this... You haven't seen what an amazing performance I can give!|next,7|Mothiva, we should retreat for now.|next,8|I know that. And not because you told me!|next,7|We'll meet again, Team Snakemouth.
|tail,-6|The things some would do for fame...|next,-4,Idle||face,-4,-5|I mean, I almost can't blame her. Getting an artifact really bumps |line|you up in the ranks!|next|Not like I was gonna let them take it from us, though!|next,-5|Well, despite that unexpected detour, we should be able to proceed now.|next,-6|We sense some strong magic up there. Let's make sure we're prepared.
Oi, Kabbu!
|flip,caller,false||align,left,true|Oh, are you explorers? You've got that reliable aura!|next,-5,Happy|That's correct! Madeleine, I presume?|next,caller|That's me. I'm so grateful for your help! You see...|next|Seb, my dear butler, got lost while we enjoyed our pilgrimage.|next|I've searched quite a bit, but I am helpless finding my way without him! |next|Pretty please... Could you try and find him for me?|next,-6|How's he like? It'd help us.|next,caller|Right. He's precious, tiny...with an orange bowtie! He shouldn't have gone |line|too far. |next|Please do your best, yes? I'll reward you appropriately.|next,-4|Heheh. We're on it! Just hang in there!|flag,198,true|
Oh, please! Find him soon! If anything happens to him...I don't |line|know what I'd do!
|hide||event,103|
Seb, my dear! You're safe!|next,1000|Milady! I'm sorry to have troubled you so...|next,caller|Oh, how would my life be without you to help me?|next,1000|I can only hope my absence would be noted, Milady.|next,caller|But of course. Oh, brave explorers... I can't thank you enough!|next,-4,Happy|I can think of one or two nice ways of saying thanks!|next,caller||flip,caller|Heheh. No worries. I haven't forgotten your |wavy|HUGE|wavy| kindness.|next|As a token of my gratitude, I hope you will make good use of this.
|flip,caller|With that said, shall we head home? I fancy some Burly Tea.|next,1000|Of course, Milady. With some sweet bread?|next,caller||flip,caller|You know me too well! Brave explorers... May we meet again |line|sometime!
|checkflag,198,17||tail,-4|Madeleine's got some good style going on.|next,-6|Vi, ever thought of carrying an umbrella around?|next,-4|Nah, I'd just get tired. Hey, Kabbu. What about you?|next,-5|Hmm. You think I should try it? I could look so pretty!|next,-6|Err, sure. If you say so... 
|tail,-6|We've got a hunch that this is Madeleine. Shall we say hello?
Impure!?|halt|
|tail,-5|We should be able to reach the upper level now!|next,-6|Hmm... Something's odd. Let's make sure we're ready.|flag,663,true|
