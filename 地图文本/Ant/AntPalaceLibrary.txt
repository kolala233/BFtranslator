A portrait of Queen Elizant I.
What a masterful painting. It truly captures Elizant's graceful demeanor.|next,-4|Grace, huh. I guess the new Queen has more of a power aura!|next,-6|Mhm. Elizant was as kind as they came. Even some monsters would be friendly in her presence.|next|Her voice was soothing, and she saw the future in a bright light.|next,-5|It must have been an honor.
