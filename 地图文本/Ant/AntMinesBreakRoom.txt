|tail,-4|Whew. I'm beat. Let's rest up!|next,-5|This break room's for the miners!
Is it a good idea to dig THERE? Hope it doesn't backfire...
|tail,-6|What's the point of holding a stop sign in the mines? Can't she just yell "stop"?|next,-5|We shouldn't assume any of the extreme dangers that come with breaking rocks!
|tail,-4|The miners look cool. Way cooler than they need to!|next,-6|Might as well do their job in style.|next,-5|(Should we work on our style more...?)
The Defiant Root tunnel's coming along. I'm glad it'll be next to the Bee elevator!
Digging's gonna be easy. Setting the entrance with all that grass, though...
A-Am I really the right one to dig at that scary place?
I hate Metal Island. I'm not even gonna get paid enough to afford food there.
I quit farming to mine, but maybe that wasn't the best choice...
