I've heard of this place. It's the War Room!|next,-4|So what, they fight in here?|next,-5|Err, no. This is a place to discuss strategy and missions...|next,-4|Should just call it the Mission Room, then!|next,-6|Vi's observations are, as always... very on point.|next,-4,Angry|What's that supposed to mean!?

It's no problem! We can be friends still. Although I have little to offer.|next,-6,Idle|N-No, it's not that. We'd be pleased to be friends.|next,caller|Hohoh! Wonderful!

Leif...
|checktrue,555,10||checktrue,348,9|It's good to see you again. You bring me some peace of mind. I worry about Ellie too much!
|checkflag,136,5|So Rebecca was around, even in the early days?|next,-6|Yeah. She was taller but dressed the same.|next,-4|She's really stuck around...I've never met a bug so old!|next,-6|Right here.|next,-4|Eep! U-Um, sorry!|next,-5,Happy|Heheh.|next,-6||face,-6,-5|Really?|next,-5,WeakBattleIdle|...I thought it was funny.
|tail,-6|...! Could it be? We must speak to her!
Team Snakemouth... I apologize in behalf of my people, but right now I am powerless.|next|I shall help in any way I can, however. Please be careful, the Forsaken Lands are mysterious and a true maze.|next|Only the Termites themselves know the way through that place.|next|...You're the ones who found all the artifacts of legend, so maybe you can do it. Good luck.

Most just follow |line|whoever's in the throne. |next|But we love our Queen, so it just feels a bit sad...|next,-5|You've truly grown, Vi!|line|Your maturity shines pride on me!|next,-4,Flustered|Stop it! You're embarassing me!|next,-6|Guess you're not THAT mature yet...
Oh, you managed to get through the Forsaken Lands?|next|You truly are exceptional fellows... if only you were there at the|line|Wasp Kingdom at the time...|next|This all could have been prevented...|next|Oh, don't mind me. Just thinking out aloud... 
My my! Such a ruckus outside! You young ones are so full of energy!
Oh dear. I missed a whole war?|next|...You all protected Ellie, didn't you? Thank you.

Oh, it's you young'uns!|next,-6|Rebecca... You'll really go to the Abandoned City? For what purpose?|next,caller|It may look a bit dreadful... But I have many great memories there.|next|Won't you come with me? I have a tale or two to share.@EVENT@|shaky|Absolutely not!
There is no way you're stepping outside this castle!|next|Have you forgotten your age?|next,caller|...Now, that's not very kind.|next|These young'uns saved the Kingdom! I have nothing to fear.|next,-5|...She's right about that.
