Why do you desire the sapling? Why go through all this?|next,-5|I assumed it would be to keep yourself young and fit to rule...|next,-4|Uh, right. No one wants to get old!|next,antq|...Fair assumptions. But no, it was never something for my own gain.|next|I might as well tell you, then. The reason for my search.
The true Queen, Elizant I... My mother, she yet lives.
She was put in a deep slumber, using crystal energy. A sort of stasis.|next|It was her dream to get the sapling so she could continue to rule Bugaria for years to come.|next|...I wished only to bring her back with it.|next|A graceful Queen, loved by all. A diplomatic genius, who ended wars |line|without combat.|next|I longed for her return... So that |line|I may concede my throne to her.|next|For she is so much more than I have ever been.|next,-6|...|next|We truly thought wrong of your intentions. But the truth sounds |line|even more insane...|next,-4|Wow! That's awesome!|minibubble,@...,maki||minibubble,@...,kina||minibubble,@...,-6||next,-5|Um, I'm not sure if that would be my reaction...|next,-4,Angry|We need to go beat up the King! Whatever he wants isn't any better!|next,-5|If we knew where he was going, we would have some chance, but...|next,neo,Idle||flip,neo||face,maki,neo|A-Actually! I do know where! Probably!|next,kina|Were you ever gonna tell us? Speak up!|next,neo|R-Right. I was, uh, waiting for the right moment. The King is certainly going for the sapling, yeah?|next|Analyzing everything we know so far, my conclusion is the sapling must be in the |color,1|Giant's Lair|color,0|!
|minibubble,@...,antq|You mean that giant wall we can see from the big tree? The haunted place?! THAT Giant's Lair?!?!|next,antq||destroyminibubble||flip,neo||face,maki,antq|A towering behemoth of steel and wood, said to have housed the previous rulers of these lands. The so called giants.|next|It is forbidden to go there. None who enter have come back.|next,maki|...In hindsight, it makes sense it'd be there. Even if we needed the artifacts to enter.|next,kina|We need a boat to get there though. Doubt the Wasps will|line|let us sail in fine and dandy.|next,zaryant|Tch. They were one step ahead of us. We had just received reports that the ships at the pier were sunk by the Wasps!|next,-4,Sad|W-What do we do, then? Bees can't build boats or anything... 
...! |face,party,waspq|If you'd allow me to suggest something, why not ask the |line||color,1|Termite Kingdom|color,0|?|next,-4|There's a Termite Kingdom?|next,-5|They are an isolationist yet advanced society that lives just outside Bugaria...|next|They hate daylight so they don't make much contact.|next|Some species go for a visit, but they forbid entrance to all Ants.|next,-6|...Or that's how they used to be. |face,party,antq|Right, our Queen?|next,antq|When my mother went into her sleep, I was not...skilled enough to maintain her level of diplomacy. |line|And our alliance fell apart.|minibubble,@My Queen...,zaryant||next|But they are our only hope. I will go, injured though I may be. I shall request an audience and do what it takes.|destroyminibubble||next,zaryant,Angry||face,antq,zaryant|I must oppose! The Termites live deep in the |color,1|Forsaken Lands|color,0|! That area is teeming with dangerous beasts!|next|You must NOT put yourself in such danger! I will prepare envoys at once!
|music,Inside2|If this was any other time, I would agree with you... But there is no |line|choice!|next|We are only in dire straits because of me. I will go myself, and that is final.|next,zaryant,Idle|Hnngh...|next,maki||face,antq,maki|If only I was strong as you, my Queen. Injured as I am...|next,antq|Maki, Zaryant, you two rally up all explorers. Do not let rumors and panic spread. |next|When we return, we shall strike the Wasps.|next|They most certainly have seized the |color,1|Rubber Prison|color,0| as we speak. |next|That is the only known way inside the Giant's Lair from Bugaria.|next|But right now we will move to the Forsaken Lands. I will need an escort to ensure I arrive at the Termite Kingdom.|next|Team Snakemouth, I shall wait for you in the |color,1|Golden Path Tunnel|color,0|. The old entrance to the Forsaken Lands is located there.|next|Also, Vanessa, please feel free to stay at our palace. |next|We do not have much to offer, but we will make sure to treat you as you deserve.|next,waspq|Why, you have my gratitude Elizant. It seems you misjudge your |line|ability to impress and court!|next|Our mothers may have had trouble in the past, but we can change the relationship between Ants and Wasps for generations to come.|next,antq|...Is that so? Then let us share a meal when this is all dealt with.|next|Team Snakemouth, we must hurry. Do not keep me waiting.
Team Snakemouth... Please protect the Queen.|next,-6|You can count on us.
You remember how to get to the Golden Path Tunnel, right? It is just |line|south of the Association.|next|Please be careful, the Forsaken Lands are always shrouded in fog, and many dangerous beasts lurk within.|next,-5|Leave it to us!
|checktrue,555,127|So this is it... The artifacts have been all rounded up.|next,-5|Indeed. The sapling is finally within reach.|next,-4,Angry|Of the Wasp King!|next,caller|Be careful, everyone! I'll be rooting for you!
