|checkflag,67,8|The palace... I was fortunate to be born in a time when explorers can |line|visit it.|next,-6|True. Back then, the Queen had to personally extend an invite...|next,-4,Happy|Oooh. Did you get to visit, Leif?|next,-6|Yeah. We were one of the first non-Ant teams willing to explore...|next,-6,WeakBattleIdle|Although we all know how that turned out.|next,-4,Sad||anim,-5,WeakBattleIdle|S-Sorry.|next,-6,Idle|It's okay. Shall we go?
Maki. There you are. You know the Queen hates waiting.|next,-5|Please forgive us for the delay.|next,-4|We're ready, though!|next,1000||face,-4,1000||face,-5,1000||face,-6,1000|Then you wouldn't mind if we stepped right in?|next,-6|No objections. The sooner we answer our doubts, the better.|next,caller|That'll do. Let us proceed, then.
Hey, explorers. I'd come visit the mines if I were you! It's a work in |line|progress, but it's only going to improve!
Halt. Only palace dwellers are allowed beyond this point.|line|Have a good day.|next,-4,Angry|Geez. I wanted to get mad, but she was way too polite!
|checkflag,67,10||tail,-6|Now that's a big door.|next,-4|I bet there's huge treasure on the other side!|next,-5|Hmm...not quite. Ants have their own society isolated within this anthill.|next|There are probably housings and other structures for them to come back to after a hard day of work.|next,-6|There's probably a lot of hoarded food, too.|next,-4|Not listening. I'm not giving up on my big treasure dreams!
|tail,-4|Hmmmmmmm...|next,-5|Um, what is it, Vi?|next,-4|This is a miner ant, right?|next,-6|Seems like it.|next,-4|But she's not mining at all! She's just guiding people to the mine!|next||anim,-4,Flustered|It's like studying to be a chef, but having to work at the bank!|next,-6||anim,-4,Idle|You've made us feel a bit sorry for her...|next,-5|Don't be like that, you two. Maybe she doesn't even like mining, and this is her dream job! Guess we'll never know... 
|tail,-4||anim,-4,Happy|Alright! We did it! Look at all these berries! Heheh...|next,-5,Happy||face,-5,-4|Hehe. I got a big scare earlier, but I have to admit... We did really well!|next,-4||face,-4,-5|We've got to celebrate! Maybe in the Golden Hills festival!|next,-5,Idle|T-That's right! How fortunate that our expedition would line up with such an occasion!|next,-6|...|next,-4,Angry||face,-4,-6||face,-5,-6|Uh, Leif? You could |wavy|pretend|wavy| to be happy or something.|next,-6|Vi...Kabbu... May we confess something?|next,-5|Hm?|next,-6|When our team left for Snakemouth...|next||face,-6,-4||anim,-6,WeakBattleIdle|The Queen was Elizant the First.|music,null||next,-4,Surprized||music,Moth||anim,-5,WeakBattleIdle|WHAT!?|next,-5,WeakBattleIdle|W-What!? Leif, that is not possible!|next,-4|Y-Yeah! I wasn't even born when the new Queen took the throne!|next,-6|It's...|fwait,0.2|it's the truth.|next|The plaza has changed, there's a new Queen, we can't find our team anywhere...|next|We've been trapped for...decades? We don't even know.|next|We hoped we were just fuzzy, but walking around has confirmed it.|next,-5,Idle|Leif...!|next,-6|And this new Queen, she rubs us the wrong wa-|next,-4,Flustered|S-Shh! You can't just say that in here!|next,-6,Idle||anim,-4,Sad|Elizant the First was kind and understanding... This new Queen doesn't|line|quite live up to her.|minibubble,@...,-4||minibubble,@...,-5||next,-6||destroyminibubble||flip,-6|...Sorry. Too much has happened. We didn't get a chance to ask anything, either.|next,-4|Yikes, what should we do? This isn't normal at all...|next,-5|Leif|minibubble,@...,-6|...|next,-5|I cannot understand the pain you are feeling. Probably there is no one who can.|next|But come with us. Maybe as we explore, we'll find the truth behind what|line|has happened to you!|minibubble,31,-6||next,-4|Uh, yeah! Maybe there's clues around, or something...|next,-6||destroyminibubble||face,-6,-4|...Alright. Once again, we're left with little choice. You're fun to be around, at least.|next,-4,Happy|Well, yeah!|next,-5|Thank you, Leif. Together, we conquered Snakemouth...|next|And together, we will figure this out!|next,-6|For now, let's focus on this mission. We'll be okay.|next,-4,Idle|Alright! Let's head on south, for clues and glory!|minibubble,17,-5||anim,-5,WeakBattleIdle||next||destroyminibubble||end|
Only palace dwellers are allowed beyond this point. Get out.|next,-4,Angry|What's her problem!?
What an imposing atmosphere... The castle is stunning.|next||gettail,46|There will be time for awe later. Let us go.
Stay focused. That is not the right place to go.
That's a big door.|next,1000|That's an area only Ants can enter. Not even I know what is beyond that door.|next,-5|Hm...such mystery.|next,1000|We should head for the throne room, though.|next,-5|Yes, I apologize. Let's get back on track.
Please, let me thank you. In the name of many good bugs lost to Snakemouth... it's a relief to know |line|others won't venture in anymore.|next,-5,WeakBattleIdle|Indeed... Our search for the artifact has helped others.|line|I am truly glad.|next,-6,WeakBattleIdle|(If only we had bested it back then...)
|tail,-4|The laiu... lieu... the ant captain's really cool!|next,-5|Lieutenant, Vi.|next,-4|...As I was saying, pretty cool!|next,-5|Maki, Zaryant... The Queen has quite a dependable ensemble.|next,-6|We just hope they follow out of more than obligation.
We should head to the audience... 
|tail,16||face,16,-1||face,17,-1|I wonder why the Queen called all of us...|next,17|Whatever it was, it wasn't me!
Oh no... Maki is still not back! And we have to meet the Queen... |wavy|Ugh.
|tail,-5|Heh. I've never been to the Hive! This is a good opportunity.|next,-4,Angry|Uh huh...|next,-5||face,-5,-4||face,-6,-4|Vi, are you okay? I know you're not on the best terms, but-|next,-4|Look, I don't wanna talk about it right now. Okay?|next,-5,WeakBattleIdle|Ah...|next,-6|Well, if you don't want to talk about it... There's something we want to discuss.|next,-4,Idle||face,-4,-6||face,-5,-6||anim,-5,Idle|What's up?|next,-6|Venus mentioned that our...our team got away from Snakemouth's |line|depths.|next,-6,WeakBattleIdle|Given the passage of time, they're most likely gone. But, we can't help but think...|next||anim,-6,Idle|Maybe their children are around. Do you follow?|next,-4,Happy|Oh. Oh! That's right! Your team can be around in spirit!|next,-5|Leif, you'd like to go look for them?|next,-6|We're in the middle of a mission, so there's no rush. But if we ever find the time...|next,-4,Idle|No problem! We'll just find them as we go along!|next,-5|Indeed. We'll keep our eyes open.|next,-6|...Thank you. That's all. Let's get on with the mission.|next,-4,Sad|Uh, right... Yeah. Let's go.|minibubble,@Oh dear...,-5||breakend|
|anim,-5,WeakBattleIdle|(Leif...)
The Wasps...just left.|next|Yet I feel they will return... We must prepare!|next|At least Rebecca is safe. She doesn't even seem to have noticed what happened... 
With the Wasps gone we managed to clear out most blockades already.|next|That's Ant Efficiency for you!
...! Something is wrong!
...Team Snakemouth...!|next|Hurry!
...I feel like something is happening in the throne room...|next|But I am too afraid to check it out.
...I can't believe it. This is the second time the Wasps attacked us.|next|We really need to revise our security.
|shaky|M-Muh muh!
Yin is shaking badly...|next,-6|Something is going on at the throne room... 
What's going on? What's the big ruckus?|next,-5|Well, you see... @EVENT@What!? To think this would happen behind our backs...|next,mothiva,Angry|This is your fault! How dare you all lose!|next,maki|We did what we could. At least we can say we were present.|next,mothiva|Why you...|next,kina|Mothiva... You've gotta learn to shut up sometimes!|next,zasp,BattleIdle|Watch your mouth, pink freak.|next,maki,BattleIdle|Watch |wavy|your|wavy| mouth, lest it suffers an unfortunate strike.|minibubble,27,kina||next,mothiva|Shut it! Or we'll take you all on right now!|next,-6|We can't afford to waste any time. We can argue when the kingdom's safe.|next,maki,Idle|Hmph. It's good to see some have their priorities straight. We'll go ahead on our task now. Try not to beat each other up.|minibubble,@Muh muh!,yin|
|anim,kina,Idle||wavy|Hehe, Maki~!
Must we always have these quarrels?|next,mothiva|Well, duh! Do you know how frustrating it is to live in your short, |line|meager shadow!?|next,-4,Flustered|Come on! We've beat you once already! Shut up!|minibubble,@Take a hint.,-6||next,zasp|As if you're the only team who's grown.|next,mothiva,Idle|Whatever. We'll settle this later. Can't get too agitated before my show today.|next,-6||destroyminibubble|You're a paragon of chivalry... Anyways, we're off to the Termite |line|Kingdom, so don't bother us.|minibubble,29,zasp||next,mothiva|Don't care. See you, dorks!
|anim,zasp,Angry|(The Termite Kingdom?|fwait,2||blank|...Interesting.)
|wavy|Sigh...|wavy|Let's uh, prepare and head to the meeting point...
The truth...|halt|
The sapling's chapter is finally closed. It's a shame we could not obtain it.|next|Even so, the Queen seems more determined than ever. Under her rule, |line|prosperity awaits the Ant Kingdom!
|tail,-4|The laiu... lieu... the ant captain's ok! Phew!|next,-5|Lieutenant, Vi.|next,-6|Is this the time to correct her grammar?|next,-5|...You're right. I'm glad she's okay as well.
