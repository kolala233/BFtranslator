|tail,-6|Just what is Elizant up to with all these tunnels?|next,-5|It seems the Queen hopes to connect many parts of Bugaria |line|with these Ant Tunnels.|next,-4|It's gonna make clearing quests a breeze!|next,-6|Sure hope there's not an ulterior motive...
|wavy|Phew...|wavy||wait,0.2| I've finally finished the Defiant Root pathway. Now I can |line|visit the wonderful Bee Kingdom whenever I want!|next|Shopping, the museums, the food... Ah! Why was I born as an ant?
Stand back!|next|If I hurt you swinging this thing, I'll get in trouble with the boss.
Hey, you're the team that brought the artifact from Snakemouth, aren't ya?|next|I'm the overseer here at the mines. We're digging tunnels across all of Bugaria to make life easier for everyone.|next|Currently only explorers can use the tunnels we've finished. We haven't opened them to the public yet.|next|We do have someone out to open them, but she's probably slacking off.|next|We're behind schedule already... I hope the Queen doesn't get mad at us again.|flag,69,true|
This compass always points to this big crystal. Use it whenever |color,1|you want to travel back here|color,0|.|next|There's quite a few tunnels leadin' back here already, the compass will take you to them!|flag,373,true|
|checktrue,78@79,29|Have you seen Diana? She should be giving finishing touches to the spots leading back here.|next|She's probably lazing off somewhere though... If you see her, |line|speed her up a bit.
|wavy|ZzZzZzZzZzZzZz... 
Metal Island... It's just so expensive! I can't even imagine what kind of bugs do business there!|next|Why does the Queen want a tunnel there? Just to save on boat fare...?
Oi, Team Snakemouth! During the attack, a piece of the main crystal fell off. |next|We turned it into a pretty nifty tool for you! Would you mind testing it?|break||giveitem,1,37,4|
Hmm. Rocks are simple to break through. The Far Grassland's flora was a big challenge, though.
Great, from farmer to miner. Ugh, I wish I could just run a shop...
T-The Forsaken Lands are so creepy. We needed a lot of escorts while digging.|next|I'm so glad we're done working there...
|tail,-4|The miners look cool. Way cooler than they need to!|next,-6|Might as well do their job in style.|next,-5|(Should we work on our style more...?)
|tail,-6|What's the point of holding a stop sign in the mines? Can't she just yell "stop"?|next,-5|We shouldn't assume any of the extreme dangers that come with breaking rocks!

|showmoney|Hello, Team Snakemouth. I can bring you to many places, some for a small fee. Any of these sound appealing?
Hm... I see. I shall be waiting.
Nowhere.
Ant City Plaza
Patton's Hut - 10 berries
Snakemouth Den - 5 berries
Bugaria Pier - 8 berries
Sorry. You don't have enough berries. Can't take you there for free,|line|that's not how things work.
Ok. I must ask you to close your eyes, though. These routes are top |line|secret...
Is there a need to wear a cloak inside a mine?|next,-4|It's super dusty! We should wear cloaks here too!|next,-6|Eh. We bet she just wants to look mysterious...
Watch out! This tunnel here leads to Rubber Prison and Giant's Lair!|next|Whatever you want there, don't blame me if anything goes wrong!
One Ant could've never done all this. That's the beauty of teamwork for you.
Ugh. Never expected the Wasps to drill from under the castle... Our tunnels are all messed up now!|next|At least the main crystal is unharmed.
Glad everything is fixed now! Thanks for your help!|next|Can't believe Nessa slept through all that ruckus, though. I swear she only works when no one is looking.
We...We did it! All tunnels are complete! Diana's back, too!
