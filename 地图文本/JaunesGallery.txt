|checktrue,437,21||tail,-4,Sad|C-Can we go?|next,-6|Something wrong?|next,-4|I just...don't wanna be here... |wavy|Sigh|wavy|.
...So you've finally come crawling back.|next,-4|...Jaune.|next,-5|Miss, we-|next,-6|Let's give the two of them some space, Kabbu.|minibubble,@O-Okay.,-5||next,caller|What do you want? I'm busy. The Queen's commissioned me for a |line|birthday piece.|next|That |wavy|horrendous|wavy| art you hate so much is doing quite well!|next,-4|T-That's uh, really cool. My team and I had this cool mission at the factory.|next,caller|The factory? You're the one who solved the lockdown? N-Not that I'm impressed.|next|So you managed to squeeze your way into an exploration team. Color me shocked.|next|Didn't expect it from such a petite child.|next,-4,Angry|You're still gonna treat me like a kid!?|next,caller|Yes! If only I was crass enough to treat you with half the disrespect you've shown me your whole life!|next,-4,Flustered|I came to say sorry, but you're making it really hard!|next,caller|I do not want your empty apologies! You seem to be doing quite|line|well anyways, ain't you?|next|Just go. Play with your team or whatever. I've got my issues to solve.|next,-4,Sad|S-Seriously? You're kicking me out!? I'm saying sorry!|next,caller|I've got to finish this piece, but I can't find any |color,1|red paint|color,0|.|next|That's all I can afford to worry about now. I certainly can't waste my time...|next|With a mean, greedy, selfish child like you!|next,-4,Flustered||boxstyle,1||shaky|FINE! YOU'RE DUMB ANYWAYS!|shaky| I was even gonna say your|line|art got better!|next,caller|You've said enough about my art for a lifetime, Vi. Just leave me alone!|next,-5||boxstyle,0|T-This isn't going well...|next,-4||boxstyle,1||shaky||flip,-4|WE'RE LEAVING.|shaky||next,-6||boxstyle,0|Vi...|next,-4||boxstyle,1||shaky|NOW!
Shoo! I'm busy! Go play with your team or something!
Can you two wait here?|next,-6|Are you sure you don't need backup?|next,-5|We've got your back!|next,-4|It's ok. I think I gotta do it myself. Just wait a bit!
Vi! I didn't expect you to come back...|next|It seems I wasn't clear enough during our last exchange!|next|You've hurt me deeply, I'm busy, and someone uncaring like yo-
Mother of all bees! That's... 
Some super premium, Golden Settlement red paint!|next,caller,Idle|You've gone and gotten it to rub your riches in my face!?|next,-4,Angry|Nope. Just gonna leave it here.
I'm sorry, Jaune. I hope your painting comes out good.|next|I'll get going now... 
Wait just one moment!|next,-4,Sad||flip,-4|Y-Yeah?|next,caller|Red paint is off season, and hugely requested as it is.|next|I know you didn't just walk into a store for it...|next|Why make an effort after I've gone and shouted at you?|next,-4,Angry|I woulda done it faster if you'd been nice and asked!|next,caller|...|next,-4|I AM sorry I said you draw like a weevil. And all the other stuff.|next|You weren't believing me, so I had to go EVERYWHERE for the darn paint!|next,caller|Violet...|next,-4,Sad|B-But if I can say something, you were mean to me too!|next|I had dreams and you stomped over them!|next|I'm doing great! I've gone to many places and beat up huge monsters!|next|If...if you had any faith in me I could've done it sooner!|next,caller|I...|next|.......
I was quite inconsiderate, wasn't I? My little sister...|next|Please forgive me.|next,-4,Idle|Only if you forgive me back!|next,caller|...It's settled then. Welcome home.|next,-4|Jaune!
|anim,caller,102|I missed you... But I felt if I let things slide it wouldn't be right.|next,-4||anim,caller,101|I don't wanna be a jerk, but I didn't miss the Hive at all.|next|...I did miss you just a little bit.
Could you step out with your friends for a few minutes?|next|There's something I've got to finish. And that I want to show you.|next,-4|Oh, uh. Okay. I'll go tell them!
Welcome! It's good to see you all again.|next,-5|Um yes. Let us leave last time behind us.|minibubble,@Pleased.,-6||next,-4|What's the thing you were finishing? The Queen's present?|next,caller,Happy|Not at all. This one will make her painting look dull.|next|I've had this project for a long time, but not the heart to finish it...|next|I'm grateful I get to show it to you.|next,-4|Stop hyping it up! I wanna see it!|next,caller|Hehehe. Oh, what a great audience! Get ready!
I call this... "A Bond Thicker Than Honey"!@EVENT@Hohoho! Its beauty moves you to tears!|next,-4|Jaune... 
...A-Aww... 
|wavy|S-sniff...!
|anim,caller,101|You're really the best artist in the Hive!|next,caller||anim,caller,102|And you its best explorer!|next|Let's not fight again, alright?|next,-4||anim,caller,101|Never!
Vi can now use the |color,1|Sharing Stash|color,0| skill in battle!
Hey, Vi. I AM a bit busy with Queen's Gift, but...If you want, you |line|can all rest here!|prompt,map,1.5,2,19,20,@Thanks!,@No Thanks!|
Just make sure not to knock anything over!|break||innsleep,-0.8,0,-1,true|
Alright. Stay as long as you want, if you wish to see me working!
|checktrue,445,22||tail,-4,Sad|Let's go. No point coming back until we've got the paint... 
|anim,-5,Happy||anim,-4,Happy|All's well that ends well!|next,-6|You did it, Vi. We're extra happy for you.|next,-4|Heheheh. It was worth every berry!
|checktrue,445,24||anim,-4,Sad|So this is Vi's sister...|minibubble,@...,-4||next,-6|All bees are sisters, aren't they?|next,-5|Well, yes. But even in a huge colony, some get more attached to others.|next,-6|We guess so. No point in thinking about it too much.
|tail,-4|So...yeah. Jaune's my sis.|next,-6|All bees are sisters, aren't they?|next,-4|Well, yeah. But I grew up with her! So we're special sisters!|next,-5|In a way, it seems bees do choose their family...
