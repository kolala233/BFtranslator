|checkflag,41,9|Ah, this is where we met Chuck.|next,-4|Oh yeah. Where did he go anyways?|next,-6|Well, he couldn't have gone far?|next,-5|He mentioned building a "cozy" space for explorers. He must be |line|nearby!
Excuse me, bug of old complexion. Is everything alright?|next,-4||face,-4,-5|Hey! Kabbu! We're supposed to be adventuring! Snakemouth Den? Endless |line|riches?|next,-5|Sorry, Vi. I cannot ignore an old bug in distress.|next,2|First of all, name's Chuck. And I bet I'm younger than both of ya!|line|But if you've gotta know... 
I'm almost done arranging my cozy rest space for travelers |line|going to Snakemouth Den. I just can't pull out this darn weed!|next,-4|You call this cozy?|next,-5|Chuck, Snakemouth Den is more dangerous than rain on a wedding day. Shouldn't you be warning travelers?|next,2|...Look, will you help me or not?|next,-4||anim,-4,Angry|I'm not doing any pulling. At least not for free.
Hm. Watch this, Vi. If I press |button,5| near small bushes or rocks... 
Woah! Nice.|next,-5|Something like this is no match for my horn!
And you didn't do anything.|halt|
|anim,-4,Happy||tail,-4,instant|Berries, so many berries!|next,2|Use 'em to buy something nice later, alright?|next,-5|Thank you, we surely will. We'll be going now. Make sure to warn others of the danger!
Good luck, ye two!
I'll be! You actually helped me! This made my week!|next,-4|You've got a reward ready, right?|next,-5||anim,-5,Idle|But Vi! Helping others is already its own reward.|minibubble,5,-5||next,-4||destroyminibubble|It's really, really not.|next,2|Hohohoh. No worries. Helpful bugs deserve gratitude! I ain't got much, but please take this.
This is one of the Ant Kingdom's outskirts.|next,-4|You know what it's not? Snakemouth Den. Let's go!
|tail,-5||face,-5,-4|Where are you going? Snakemouth is through the north west!|next,-4||face,-4,-5|Uh, yeah. I knew that.

|tail,-4|Hey, isn't this the Ant we met at the gate near the association?|next,-5|Indeed. It seems she was reassigned here after we |line|found the artifact.|next,-4|She looks so bored. I guess nothing really happens here.
Ugh. This post is so boring. No one comes here now that the artifact has been found...|next|At least that old bug that lives nearby says hi sometimes.
|boxstyle,3||spd,0|As of the latest decree, the path to Snakemouth Den is closed off by |line|the Queen's orders.|next||spd,0|If you have any complaints please direct it to the Ant Kingdom Safety Committee.
If you are near something that can be interacted with using the horn, |line|a |icon,223| will show up over the party leader's head.
